           Maester Pycelle stands over Tyrion as he awakens.  His face 
           is covered with bandages.

           Podrick bursts into the room where Pycelle stands over 
           Tyrion. 
                          TYRION 
                   Find Bronn or Varys.  Tell them I am 
                   here with Maester Pycelle.  Tell them I 
                   am very much alive. 
                          POD 
                   Yes, my lord. 
                    
           Pod leaves the room.

                   Would you like something for the pain? 
                          TYRION 
                   What happened? 
                          PYCELLE 
                   The murderer and traitor, Stannis 
                   Baratheon, suffered a stunning defeat 
                   at the hand of your father. 
                          TYRION 
                   Where am I? 
                          PYCELLE 
                   These are your new chambers.  A little 
                   cramped, perhaps, but you don’t need 
                   much room, do you?   
                    
           Pycelle chuckles to himself, but Tyrion is not amused.

           Pycelle turns to leave, but pauses, and readdresses Tyrion.  
           He tosses him a gold coin before leaving. 
                          PYCELLE

           A pile of horse feces lands on the floor, dropped by a 
           horse Tywin rides ceremoniously into the Throne Room.  
           Dignitaries and the highborn stand on either side.

                   savior of the city and the Hand of the 
                   King. 
                    
           A servant rushes over to Joffrey, who sits on the throne in 
           front of Tywin.  Joffrey hands the servant the insignia of 
           office, placed upon a pillow.  The servant walks the Hand 
           pin over to Tywin, who takes it from the pillow and bows. 
                          TYWIN 
                   Thank you, Your Grace. 
                    
           Tywin rides out of the Throne Room as Joffrey and 
           Cersei look on from the dais.

                          MARGAERY 
                   With all my heart, Your Grace.  I have 
                   come to love you from afar.  Tales of 
                   your courage and wisdom have never been 
                   far from my ears, and those tales have 
                   taken root deep inside of me. 
                          JOFFREY 
                   I, too, have heard tales of your beauty 
                   and grace, but the tales do not do you 
                   justice, My Lady.  It would be an honor 
                   to return your love.  But I am promised 
                   to another.  A King must keep his word.

                   Your Grace, in the judgment of your 
                   small council, it be neither proper, 
                   nor wise, for you to wed the daughter 
                   of a man beheaded for treason.  A girl 
                   who's brother is an open rebellion 
                   against the throne as we speak.  For 
                   the good of the realm, your councilors 
                   beg you to set Sansa Stark aside.

                   I have consulted with the High Septon, 
                   and he assures me that their crimes

                   promise you have made to them, in the

                   The Gods are good.  I am free to heed 
                   my heart.  Ser Loras, I will gladly wed 
                   your sweet sister.  You will be my

                          STARK SOLDIER 2 (to Soldier 1) 
                   How do you know what a Kingslayer looks 
                   like? 
      01:15:11      
                          STARK SOLDIER 1 
                   I was at Whispering Wood.  I saw him. 
                          JAIME 
                   (LAUGH) 
                          STARK SOLDIER 1 
                   They dragged him out of the woods and 
                   threw him down before the King. 
                          BRIENNE 
                   He's not the kingslayer.  Sorry to 
                   disappoint you.  If he was, I'd only be 
                   traveling his head. 
                          STARK SOLDIER 2 
                   I have a question for you both.  And I 
                   want you to answer at the same time.  I 
                   count to three, you both answer.  
                   What's his name? 
      [MUSIC IN]    
           Jaime and Brienne exchange looks. 
                          STARK SOLDIER 2 
                   One.  Two.  Three. 
                    
           On three, Brienne pushes Jaime out of the way and draws her 
           sword.  She immediately kills Soldier 1.  She grabs his 
           dagger before he hits the ground and whips it at Soldier 3.  
           She turns and on fluid motion, severs the man's hamstrings 
           and Solider 2 falls.  Jaime watches, astonished and 
           impressed.  Brienne stands over Soldier 2. 
                          BRIENNE 
                   Two quick deaths... 
                    
           Soldier 2 squirms.  Brienne buries the sword slowly and 
           deep inside of him.  He cries out.  When the sword reaches 
           the man's heart, she pulls it out.

                   Those were Stark men. 
                          BRIENNE 
                   I don’t serve the Starks.  I serve Lady 
                   Catelyn.  I told her I'd take you to 
                   King's Landing, and that's what I'm 
                   going to do.  Stay. 
                    
           Brienne walks over to the ropes that hold up the dead 
           women's corpses.  She slices it with her sword.  They fall 
           to the ground.  Jaime turns away and grunts.

                   Walder Frey is a dangerous man to

                   And that is what would be in store for 
                   me with one of Walder Frey's daughters?  
                   What you and father had?

                   Why not?  Because she's not beautiful?  
                   Because she's not exotic and exciting? 
                          ROBB 
                   Now you're arguing just to argue, 
                   because you arranged it. 
                          CATELYN 
                   And you agreed to it.  You gave him 
                   your word.  Treat your oath recklessly 
                   and your people will do the same.  If

                   I have left has no right to call anyone 
                   reckless.

                   I fought for your God in Blackwater 
                   Bay.  I led my men to the gates of the 
                   Seventh Hell, as their brothers burned 
                   alive, and for what?  Attack from 
                   behind by Tywin Lannister and the 
                   Tyrells.  If you see so much in your 
                   flames, why didn’t you warn me?

                   This war is has just begun.  It will

                          THEON 
                   First time I saw Winterfell, it looked 
                   like something that had been here for 
                   thousands of years, and would be here 
                   for thousands of years after I was 
                   dead.  I saw it and I thought, of 
                   course Ned Stark crushed our rebellion 
                   and killed my brothers.  We never stood 
                   a chance against the man who lives 
                   here. 
                          LUWIN 
                   Lord Stark went out of his way to make 
                   it your home. 
                          THEON 
                   Yes, my captors were so very kind to 
                   me.  You love reminding me of that.

      01:23:52      
                          THEON 
                   You know what it's like to be told how 
                   lucky you are to be someone's prisoner?  
                   To be told how much you owe them?  And 
                   then to go back home to your real 
                   father. 
                    
           The war horn blows.  Theon stands, angry. 
                          THEON 
                   I will kill that man!  I swear to the 
                   Drowned God, the old Gods, the new 
                   Gods, to every fucking god in every 
                   fucking heaven, I will kill that man! 
                          LUWIN 
                   Theon, listen to me.  I serve 
                   Winterfell.  Now Winterfell is yours.  
                   I'm bound by oath to serve you. 
                          THEON 
                   And what's your counsel, trusted 
                   friend? 
                          LUWIN 
                   Run.  Five hundred Northmen wait 
                   outside the walls.  You have twenty 
                   men.  You can't win.  Wait for 
                   nightfall and run. 
                          THEON 
                   There's nowhere to run.   
                    
           Luwin rolls his eyes. 
                          THEON 
                   I'll never make it back to the Iron 
                   Islands, and even if I did, even if by 
                   some miracle I slipped through the 
                   lions and made it home, I'd be a 
                   coward.  The Greyjoy who ran.  The

           Theon slumps down in his chair, defeated. 
            
      01:25:05      
                          LUWIN 
                   Don’t go home.  Join the Night's Watch.  
                   Once a man has taken the black, he's 
                   beyond reach of the law.  All his past 
                   crimes are forgiven. 
                          THEON 
                   I won't make it to the wall.  I won't 
                   make it ten feet past the Winterfell 
                   gates. 
                          LUWIN 
                   There are ways.  Hidden passageways 
                   built so the Lords of Winterfell could 
                   escape.  The road will be dangerous.  
                   But with a little luck... 
                    
           Theon considers, showing a glimmer of hope in his eyes for 
           the first time. 
                          LUWIN 
                   The Night's Watch is an ancient, 
                   honorable order.  You'll have 
                   opportunities there. 
                    
           Theon stands, suddenly angry again. 
                          THEON 
                   The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my 
                   throat in my sleep. 
                          LUWIN 
                   The opportunity to make amends for what 
                   you've done. 
                          THEON 
                   I've done a lot, haven’t I?  Things I 
                   never imagined myself doing. 
                          LUWIN 
                   I've known you many years, Theon 
                   Greyjoy.  You're not the man you're

           Luwin puts a comforting hand on Theon's shoulder. 
            
      01:26:33 
                          THEON 
                   You may be right.  But I've gone too 
                   far to pretend to be anything else. 
                    
           Luwin pats Theon on the shoulder.  The war horn blows. 
            
            
           EXT. WINTERFELL COURTYARD - DAY 
            
           Theon, dressed for battle, stands and addresses his very 
           small army of men, holding spears, but already looking 
           defeated.  The horn continues to blow. 
                          THEON 
                   You hear that?  That's the mating call 
                   of the Northmen.  They want to fuck us! 
                    
           More of Theon's men gather to hear him speak. 
                          THEON 
                   Well I haven’t had a good fuck in 
                   weeks!  I'm ready for one!

           Dagmer cracks Theon on the back of the head with the hilt

                          BLACK LORREN 
                   Thought he'd never shut up.

                   It was a good speech.  Didn’t want to 
                   interrupt.  
                    
           A few of the Ironborn saunter over and cover Theon's face 
           with a hood.  Luwin enters the courtyard, pushing an 
           Ironborn man aside. 
                          LUWIN 
                   What is this?  What are you doing?! 
                    
           Dagmer shoves his spear through Luwin's belly.  He hunches 
           over in pain and screams.

                   Don’t want to swim too close to a 
                   drowning man?  And I thought we were

           Pod opens the door to Tyrion's chamber.  Shae enters and 
           sits on Tyrion's bed.

                   There are many who know that without 
                   you, this city faced certain defeat.  
                   The king won't give you any honors.  
                   The histories won't mention you.  But 
                   we will not forget.

           uncomfortable with her presence.

                   And in sight of the Seven, I hereby

           Robb and Talisa turn to each other.

                   Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden,

                   Vaés léisi, zhey kháleesi. Me nem nésa. 
                    
                   A house of ghosts, Khaleesi.  It is

                   Let them try. 
           Without hesitation, Dany climbs the steps leading 
           to the House of the Undying.  Jorah follows.  
           Kavarro reluctantly follows.

                   Is this a riddle? 
                    
           Dany and Jorah leave Kovarro behind as they try 
           to find a way into the toweringhouse that doesn’t 
           appear to have an entryway.  Jorah walks full 
           circle and meet with Kovarro on the other side.  
           Dany is gone. 
                          JORAH 
                   Khaleesi!  Khaleesi! 
                    
           Dany has found her way inside a tunnel.  She pulls fire 
           from the wall to use for light. 
                          DANY 
                   You're trying to frighten me with magic 
                   tricks?  You want me?!  Here I am!  Are 
                   you afraid of a little girl? 
                              
           In the distance, a baby cries.  Dany moves closer 
           to the sound.

           Arya, Gendry and Hotpie walk tentatively, hoping they are 
           not being followed.  They look up and notice Jaquen standing 
           at the top of a mountain.

                   What is it?

                   A coin of great value. 
                          ARYA 
                   Could it buy a horse? 
                          JAQUEN 
                   It is not meant for the buying of 
                   horses.

                   Then what good is it?

           Jaquen turns his back on Arya, then turns to face her. His 
           face is completely different now. He is a new person. 
                          NEW JAQUEN 
                   Farewell, Arya Stark.

           The stone direwolf guards the Winterfell crypt door.  Osha 
           peeks around it.  Behind her, Bran sits in Hodor's arms in 
           the doorway while Rickon crouches beside them.

           Bran, Hodor and Rickon follow Osha into the courtyard where 
           everything has been burned.  Timbers smolder, black ash and 
           smoke twist through the air, and dead bodies litter the 
           ground.  The mood is somber as they walk through and 
           assess.  The wolves whimper from the godswood archway.  
           Hodor carries Bran through. 
            
            
           EXT. WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD - DAY 
            
           Maester Luwin sits beneath a weirwood tree, unmoving and 
           badly wounded.  Hodor carries Bran toward him.  Rickon lets 
           go of Osha's hand and runs quickly forward toward Luwin.  
           Luwin cries tears of happiness and physical pain when he 
           sees them.  He reveals his deep wounds.

                   many enemies in the south.  Go to the

                   No more than I want to leave you.  I 
                   pulled you into the world, both of you.  
                   I've seen both your faces almost every

                   myself very, very lucky.  Go now, with

           and looks up at the ceiling, which is full of holes.  Snow 
           falls all around her.  She walks over to the throne, and 
           she is just about to touch it when she hears the dragons

                   This is not my home.  My home is across 
                   the sea where my people are waiting for 
                   me.

                          PYAT PREE 
                   They will be waiting a long time. 
                    
           Dany looks over her shoulder at her dragons, chained up 
           behind her.  The dragons look to her, then Pyat Pree.

                   Dracarys. 
                    
           The dragons unleash streams of smoke, then fire on Pyat 
           Pree, setting his arm on fire.  Dany tilts her head back as 
           her dragons breathe fire on either side of her, setting 
           Pyat Pree on fire.   
                          PYAT PREE

           Pyat Pree rolls around on the ground until he is dead. 
            
            
           EXT. NORTH OF THE WALL - FROSTFAGS - DAY 
            
           The long, cold march north continues for Jon Snow, Qhorin 
           Halfhand and their wildling captors.  Jon and Ygritte 
           trudge along. 
                          YGRITTE 
                   We should be there by sundown.  Won't 
                   be a fun nap for you.  Mance knows how 
                   to make crows sing. 
                    
           Ygritte swats Jon on the head with the flat of Longclaw. 
                          YGRITTE 
                   If you know what to say, you might just 
                   make it through the night. 
                    
           Jon continues forward, saying nothing. 
                          YGRITTE 
                   Not talking's not the way to go.

           Ygritte hits Jon on the head again with Longclaw. 
                          JON 
                   Careful with that.  You might cut 
                   yourself. 
                    
           Ygritte goes for another smuck, but Jon ducks out of the 
           way. 
            
      01:52:14 
                          JON 
                   You never swung a sword before, have 
                   you?  You look like a baby with a 
                   rattle. 
                    
           Ygritte is angry and lunges forward.  Rattleshirt has had 
           enough. 
                          RATTLESHIRT 
                   Enough of that! 
                    
           Commotion breaks out behind Jon.  Qhorin seizes the 
           opportunity to elbows a wildling in the face and takes his 
           sword, then lunges forward, swinging it at Jon, then 
           punching him.  Jon falls into the snow.  The wildlings hold  
           onto Qhorin. 
                          JON 
                   Stop! 
                          QHORIN 
                   Why, traitor?!  So you can give Mance 
                   Rayder an invitation to Castle Black? 
                          WILDLING 
                   Let 'em fight! 
                    
           Ygritte throws Longclaw to Jon.  It lands in the snow 
           beside him.  Qhorin pushes away from the wildlings that 
           restrain him and lunges toward Jon as he swings his sword.  
           They fight as the wildlings stand by and watch.  The force 
           pushes Jon backwards into the wildlings.  They quickly push 
           him back toward Qhorin and the fight continues. 
                          QHORIN 
                   That's it?  That's what you can do, you

                   little shit? 
                    
           Qhorin swings again and the fighting continues. 
            
      01:53:06 
                          QHORIN 
                   Oh, your traitor father teach you that? 
                    
           Jon swings at Qhorin and moves forward.  They stand face to 
           face. 
                          QHORIN 
                   Or was it your whore mother? 
                    
           Qhorin butts his head forward into Jon's sending him into 
           the snow face down.   
            
      [MUSIC IN] 
           Jon jumps up with a newfound determination and force.  The 
           swordfight continues.  Jon knows Qhorin's sword from his 
           hands, then plunges it through Qhorin's body.  After a 
           moment, he pulls it out.  They stand face to face for a 
           moment. 
                          QHORIN 
                   Oh yeah, they're [watching?] on the 
                   wall. 
                    
           Qhorin falls on the snow, dead.  Jon stumbles. 
                          YGRITTE 
                   You can tell Mance, that's the man who 
                   killed Qhorin Halfhand. 
                    
           A wildling walks over to Jon and takes his sword.  He cuts 
           the ropes from around Jon's hands. 
                          WILDLING 
                   Burn the body.  You don’t want this one 
                   coming back for you. 
                    
           Ygritte and Jon look at each other for a long moment as Jon 
           realizes the impact of what he's done.

                   Come along, Jon Snow. 
                    
           Jon and Ygritte walk over to the mountain ledge 
           and look down.

                          YGRITTE 
                   Time to meet the king beyond the wall. 
                    
           Ygritte walks away.  Jon looks back at the fire the 
           wildlings have set to dispose of Qhorin's body.  He follows 
           Ygritte down the mountain. 
            
            
           INT. QARTH - XARO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT 
            
           Xaro sleeps peacefully next to Doreah.  An arakh point 
           enters the frame.  The blade hooks beneath the chain around 
           his neck where he keeps the key to the vault and it is 
           snapped away.  Xaro shoots up in bed.  Kovarro stands over 
           Xaro's be.d  Dany and Jorah walk forward.  Behind them, her 
           khalasar.  The dragons screech in Dany's arms. 
                          DOREAH 
                   Khaleesi, please.  He said you'd never 
                   leave Qarth alive.  And... 
                          DANY 
                   Come. 
                    
           Dany turns to leave with her dragons.  Xaro prepares to 
           jump out of bed, but Jorah draws his sword. 
            
            
           EXT. QARTH - XARO'S VAULT - NIGHT 
            
           Kovarro puts the key in the vault lock and turns it.  He 
           opens the vault.  Dany, Jorah and the Khalasar stand in 
           front of the doors, along with Doreah and Xaro.  Dany 
           enters the vault and looks inside.  It is empty. 
                          DANY 
                   Nothing. 
                    
           She turns.

                   Thank you, Xaro Xoan Daxos.  Thank you 
                   for teaching me this lesson. 
                    
           Dany nods in the direction of the khalasar.  They 
           usher Xaro and Doreah forward into the vault. 
            
      01:56:48 
                          XARO 
                   I am king of Qarth.  I can help you 
                   now.  Truly help you.  We can take the 
                   Iron Throne.  I'll bring you a 
                   thousand... 
                          DOREAH (crying) 
                   Please, khaleesi.  I beg you.  Please! 
                          XARO 
                   All of your dreams within your reach! 
                          DOREAH 
                   I beg you!  Please! 
                    
           Jorah closes the vault on Doreah and Xaro. 
                          XARO 
                   Khaleesi! 
                          DOREAH (crying) 
                   Please!  Please! 
                          XARO 
                   Khaleesi! 
                    
           The lock on the vault is turned and the key is removed with 
           Xaro and Doreah inside.  Jorah hands the key to Dany.  Her 
           khalasar collect items from around the room. 
                          JORAH 
                   It's all a lie.

           Dany holds out a gold bowl.

           Jorah takes the bowl from Dany and she walks away.  He 
           addresses the Khalasar. 
                          JORAH 
                   Mas ovray movekkhi moskay.

           The Dothraki run around grabbing all the jewels they can 
           find.  Dany carries her dragons away.

                   If you step back and think about it, 
                   the thing about Gilly that's so 
                   interesting is...

                   Bloody kill me. 
                          SAMWELL 
                   No, truly.  The thing about her that I 
                   find so interesting is that after all 
                   that Craster's done to her, she's still 
                   got hope that life might get better. 
                          DOLOROUS EDD 
                   The thing about Gilly that you find so 
                   interesting is that she said six words 
                   to you. 
                          SAMWELL 
                   And the thing about you that I find so 
                   interesting is absolutely nothing. 
                    
           A horn sounds.

                   Two blasts is wildlings.

                   You're not fighting them alone.  Come 
                   on. 
                    
           The horn sounds for the third time.  The trio stop in their 
           tracks.

                               DOLOROUS EDD 
                      Run! 
                       
             Edd and Grenn run.  Samwell stares into the distance for a 
             moment, then runs after this friends, who are much faster 
             than him. 
                               SAMWELL 
                      Wait!  Wait for me! 
                       
             Samwell falls in the snow. 
                               SAMWELL 
                      Grenn! 
                       
             Grenn and Edd are running far into the distance.  Samwell 
             lies in the snow. 
                               SAMWELL 
                      Edd! 
                       
             Samwell is alone.  He looks around, panicked.  He sees 
             shapes of people approaching in the distance through the 
             midst.  He runs and ducks behind a rock.  Behind him, dead 
             wildlings walk toward him carrying swords.  Their faces are 
             mangled, bones exposed and their clothing is tattered.  A 
             dead mangled horse chews next to Samwell.  Atop the horse 
             is a White Walker with bright blue eyes.  He stares at 
             Samwell.  Samwell cries.  The White Walker holds his sword 
             high into the air and screeches loudly.  Behind him walks a 
             huge and everlasting army of the dead.  They march past 
             Samwell's hiding place. 
              
             Fade to black.
