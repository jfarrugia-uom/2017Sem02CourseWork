           off hanging around his neck.

                   How many of those fingers do you think 
                   we could shove up his ass?

                   Is that the sort of thing… 
           Locke and the Bloody Mummers are on their horses 
           moving along the road with Jaime and Brienne.

           Jaime leans forward on his horse.

                          BRIENNE 
                   He's going to fall. 
           Locke looks back at Brienne. 
                          BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                   He's going to fall off his horse.  
                   Someone help him. 
           Jaime falls off his horse, facedown on the mud.

           Locke gets off from his horse.  Jaime tries to 
           stand up. 
                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   Water.  Please, water. 
           One of Locke's man walks towards Jaime holding a 
           water canteen. 
                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   Wa-water.  Water, please. 
           The man opens the water canteen and pours the 
           water on Jaime's head.

           A man hands Locke a water canteen. 
                          LOCKE (CONT'D) 
                   …enough.  Here. 
           Locke gives the water canteen to Jaime.  Jaime 
           drinks from the container. 
                          LOCKE (CONT'D) 
                   Can't say I've ever seen a man drink 
                   horse piss that fast.

                          VARYS 
                   As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of 
                   actors through the Free Cities.  One 
                   day in Myr, a certain man made my 
                   master an offer too tempting to refuse.  
                   I feared the man meant to use me as I'd 
                   heard some men used small boys.  But 
                   what he wanted was far worse.  He gave 
                   me a potion that made me powerless to 
                   move or speak, yet did nothing to dull 
                   my senses.  With a hooked blade, he 
                   sliced me, root and stem, chanting all 
                   the while.  He burned my parts in a 
                   brazier.  The flames turned blue and I 
                   heard a voice answer his call.  I still 
                   dream of that night.  Not of the 
                   sorcerer.  Not of his blade.  I dream 
                   of the voice from the flames.  Was it a 
                   god?  A demon?  A conjuror's trick?  I 
                   don't know.  But the sorcerer called 
                   and a voice answered. 
           Varys points the crowbar at Tyrion.

                   …I have hated magic and all those who 
                   practice it.  But you can see why I was 
                   eager to aid in your fight against 
                   Stannis and his Red Priestess.  A 
                   symbolic revenge of sorts. 
      01:06:58      
                          TYRION 
                   Yes, ahem.  I feel the need for actual 
                   revenge against the actual person who 
                   tried to have me killed.

           Varys puts the crowbar down at the table.  Then 
           he walks to a basin of water and washes his hands

                   Once I had served the sorcerer's 
                   purpose, he threw me out of his house 
                   to die.  I resolved to live to spite 
                   him. 
           Tyrion looks at the crate.

                   …body remained to me.  I became an 
                   excellent thief and soon learned that

                          VARYS (CONT'D - OS) 
                   …are more valuable than the contents of

                   Step by step, one distasteful task

                   When people talk about the Night's

                   No, the rest are there to look 
                   adoringly upon the 700 to remind them 
                   how superior they must be to have the

           Cersei and Olenna stop walking and look back at 
           Joffrey and Margaery. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   …that urn, the ashes of Aerion 
                   Targaryen. 
           Joffrey and Margaery continue walking and stop in 
           front of Cersei and Olenna. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   Aerion Brightflame they called him.  He 
                   thought drinking wildfire would turn 
                   him into a dragon.

                          JOFFREY (CONT'D)

                   all this a bit macabre? 
      01:15:20      
                          MARGAERY 
                   Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your 
                   Grace.  I'd love to see their tombs, 
                   really.  It's like taking a walk 
                   through history. 
           Joffrey puts his hand on Margaery's back and 
           guides her as they walk away.

                          CERSEI 
                   No, he wanted his remains returned to

                          OLENNA

                   I should say not.  My son's a hunter.    
                   It helps him forget he's never been 
                   within a mile of a real battle.

                   I seem to recall he laid siege to

                   year.

                   I told him to stay out of Robert's 
                   rebellion.  He had no business fighting 
                   an actual warrior.  We mothers do what 
                   we can to keep our sons from the grave.  
                   But they do seem to yearn for it.  We 
                   shower them with good sense, and it 
                   slides right off like rain off a wing.

                   I'm sorry, Your Grace.  I know they did 
                   terrible things at the end, but their 
                   ancestors built this.  Sometimes 
                   severity is the price we pay for

                   was only a boy when they took you away.

                   My father brought me and my brothers up 
                   to the bluffs so we could watch the 
                   ship that carried you off.  I remember 
                   the look on my father's face when he 
                   told us, "That's Balon Greyjoy's last 
                   living son."  And those are the words I 
                   heard over and over again when I saw 
                   what they were doing to you.

                   never told me much. 
           The rain is pouring heavily in the forest.  Reek 
           jumps off a wall.  Theon follows him.

                   costumes.  People work on them for 
                   months.
