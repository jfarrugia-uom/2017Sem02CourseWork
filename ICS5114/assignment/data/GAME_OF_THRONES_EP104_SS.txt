                       no one but this old bat for company I’d 
                       go mad.  Anyway you don’t have a choice.

             ROBB AND MAESTER LUWIN SIT ON THE RAISED DAIS AS STARK 
             GUARDSMEN ARE LINED UP.  TYRION STANDS BEFORE THEM. 
                                TYRION 
                      I must say I received a slightly warmer 
                      welcome on my last visit.     
                                ROBB 
                      Any man of the Night’s Watch is welcome 
                      at Winterfell.

                      Any man of the Night’s Watch but not I, 
                      eh boy? 
                                ROBB 
                      I’m not your boy Lannister.  I’m Lord of 
                      Winterfell while my father is away. 
                                TYRION 
                      Then you might learn a lord’s courtesy.   
             A DOOR OPENS.  TYRION TURNS AROUND TO SEE HODOR CARRYING 
             BRAN INTO THE HALL.     
                                TYRION 
                      So it’s true.  Hello Bran.

                      Do you remember anything about what 
                      happened?        
                                LUWIN 
                      He has no memory of that day.        
                                TYRION 
                      Curious.

                      Why are you here? 
                                TYRION 
                      Would your charming companion be so kind 
                      as to kneel?  My neck is beginning to 
                      hurt.

                      Kneel Hodor.       
             HODOR KNEELS DOWN AND STANDS BRAN UP SO HE’S EYE LEVEL 
             WITH TRYION.     
                                TYRION 
                      Do you like to ride Bran? 
                                BRAN 
                      Yes.  Well I mean I did like to. 
                                LUWIN 
                      The boy has lost the use of his legs.      
                                TYRION 
                      What of it?  With the right horse and 
                      saddle even a cripple can ride.   
                                BRAN 
                      I’m not a cripple.      
                                TYRION 
                      Then I’m not a dwarf.  My father will 
                      rejoice to hear it.  I have a gift for 
                      you.

                      provide the rest.   
             BRAN OPENS THE PAPER AND READS IT. 
                                TYRION 
                      You must shape the horse to the rider.  
                      And start with a yearling and teach it 
                      to respond to the reins and to the boy’s 
                      voice.     
                                BRAN 
                      Will I really be able to ride? 
                                TYRION 
                      You will.  On horseback you’ll be as 
                      tall as any of them.       
                                ROBB 
                      Is this some kind of trick?  Why do you

                      I have a tender spot in my heart for

                                ROBB 
                      You’ve done my brother a kindness.  The 
                      hospitality of Winterfell is yours.

                      Stark.  There’s a brothel outside your

                   could see that his only surviving son 
                   has turned lackey?  I still remember 
                   seeing my father’s fleet burn in

                      years before I was born.  I’ll tell you 
                      what I have seen.  Their skulls.  They 
                      used to decorate the throne room in the 
                      Red Keep.  When I was very young, just 
                      three or four, my father used to walk me 
                      down the rows and I’d recite their names 
                      for him.  When I got them all right, 
                      he’d give me a sweet.  The ones closest 
                      to the door where the last ones they 
                      were able to hatch and they were all 
                      stunt and wrong, with skulls, it’s no 
                      bigger than dog skulls.  But as you got 
                      closer to the Iron Throne, they got 
                      bigger.  And bigger.  And bigger.  There

                      That’s enough.  Sam’s no different from 
                      the rest of us.  There was no place for 
                      him in the world, so he’s come here.  
                      We’re not gonna hurt him in the training

                        unfair?  Making us take our vows while

                      I never met my mother.  My father 
                      wouldn’t even tell me her name.  I don’t 
                      know if she’s living or dead.  I don’t 
                      know if she’s a noblewoman or a 
                      fisherman’s wife.  Or a whore.  So I sat 
                      there in the brothel, as Ros took off 
                      her clothes.  But I couldn’t do it 
                      ‘cause all I could think was, what if I 
                      got her pregnant?  If she had a child, 
                      another bastard named Snow.  It’s not a 
                      good life for a child.

                                THORNE 
                      That’s admirable.  I spent six months 
                      out there, beyond the Wall, during the 
                      last Winter.  Supposed to be a two week 
                      mission.  We heard a rumor Mance Rayder 
                      was planning to attack Eastwatch.  So we 
                      went out to look for some of his men.  
                      Capture them, gather some knowledge.  
                      The wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder 
                      are hard men.  Harder than you’ll ever 
                      be.  They know their country better than 
                      we do.  They knew there was a storm 
                      coming in.  So they hide in their caves 
                      and waited for it to pass.  And we got 
                      caught in the open.  Wind so strong it 
                      yanked 100 foot trees straight from the 
                      ground roots and all.  If you took your 
                      gloves off to find your cock to have a 
                      piss, you lost a finger to the frost, 
                      and all in darkness.  You don’t know 
                      cold.  Neither of you do.  The horses 
                      died first.  We didn’t have enough to 
                      feed them to keep them warm.  Eating the 
                      horses was easy.  But later when we 
                      started to fall, that wasn’t easy.  We 
                      should’ve had a couple of boys like you 
                      along shouldn’t we.

                      a fortnight on you and still had bones 
                      left over for soup.  Soon, we’ll have 
                      new recruits.  And you lot will be 
                      passed along to the Lord Commander for 
                      assignment and they will call you men of 
                      the Night’s Watch, but you’d be fools to 
                      believe it.  You’re boys still, and come 
                      the winter you will die, like flies.

                      The Hound was just a pup, six years old 
                      maybe.  Gregor a few years older.  
                      Already a big lad, already getting a bit 
                      of a reputation.

                                LITTLEFINGER 
                      One evening Gregor found his little 
                      brother playing with a toy by the fire.  
                      Gregor’s toy.  A wooden knight.  Gregor 
                      never said a word.  He just grabbed his 
                      brother by the scruff of his neck and 
                      shoved his face into the burning coals.  
                      Held him there while the boy screamed.  
                      While his face melted.  There aren’t 
                      very many people who know that story.

                      as heard you mention it, I’m afraid all 
                      the knights in King’s Landing would not
