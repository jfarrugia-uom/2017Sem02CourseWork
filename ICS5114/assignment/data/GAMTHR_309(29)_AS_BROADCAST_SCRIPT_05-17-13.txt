           A servant hands a plate of food to Robb.  Robb takes the plate

                   ...and at my table. 
           A servant serves a plate of food to Lothar and Black Walder.  
           Black Walder takes a piece.  The servant then walks towards

                   We thank you for your hospitality, my 
                   lord. 
           Walder takes a food from the plate and eats.  Catelyn stares at 
           Robb. 
                          ROBB (CONT'D) 
                   I have come to make my apologies, my 
                   lord and to beg your forgiveness. 
           Walder's wife is standing next to him.  The servant walks away.  
           The Freys are gathered at the hall.

                   Don't beg my forgiveness, Your Grace.  
                   It wasn't me you spurned.  It was my 
                   girls. 
           Walder gestures to the women to come forward.  The women walk 
           towards the center and form two lines.  Edmure looks at them. 
                          WALDER (CONT'D - OS) 
                   One of them was supposed to be queen. 
                    
                          WALDER (CONT'D) 
                   Now none of them are.  This is

           Walder's daughters and granddaughters bow their heads to Robb as 
           Walder introduces each of them. 
                          WALDER (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...my daughter.  My daughter Walda, my

                          ROBB (CONT'D)

                   The fault is not with you.  Any man

           Blackfish and Edmure look at each other.

                          WALDER (CONT'D)                   
                   There she is. 
                    
                          WALDER (CONT'D - OS - to 
                   Talisa) 
                   Come closer. 
                    
                          WALDER (CONT'D) 
                   Let me have a look at you. 
           Talisa steps forward.  Walder leans forward, trying to see 
           Talisa's face. 
                          WALDER (CONT'D) 
                   Still can't see you.  Old eyes. 
           Talisa and Robb look at each other.  Robb gestures Talisa to 
           follow Walder's request.  Talisa moves closer and bows. 
                          WALDER (CONT'D) 
                   Love. 
                    
                          WALDER (CONT'D - OS) 
                   That's what the Starks of Winterfell 
                   call it, eh? 
                    
                          WALDER (CONT'D) 
                   (chuckles) Very honorable.  I call it a 
                   pretty...

                          WALDER (CONT'D) 
                   ...very pretty.  Prettier than this 
                   lot, that's for sure. 
           Edmure makes a face. 
                          WALDER (CONT'D) 
                   Very shapely as well. 
                    
                          WALDER (CONT'D - OS)

                   If you wanted to hide her, you           
                   shouldn't have brought her here in the 
                   first place.  I can always see what's 
                   going on beneath a dress. 
                    
                          WALDER (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Been at this a long time.  I bet when 
                   you take that dress off...

                          WALDER (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Your king says he betrayed me for love. 
                    
                          WALDER (CONT'D) 
                   I say he betrayed me for firm tits and 
                   a tight fit. 
           Robb is about to move forward, but Catelyn stops him.

           Daario moves closer to Daenerys, holds her hand and points it on 
           the map. 
                          DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                   There.  It's a back gate.  My men use 
                   it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

                   I have no interest in slaves.

                   A man cannot make love to property. 
           Daario points something on the map and looks at Barristan. 
                          DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                   This is where we enter the city.

                   Then comes the army.  Once the walls

                   hours.

                   It was the first castle on the Wall.  
                   The Watch abandoned it during the reign 
                   of King Jaehaerys I.  Too big.  
                   Impossible to maintain.  Other than 
                   Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's 
                   the perfect castle for us.  It's got a 
                   secret sally port, the Black Gate, as 
                   old as the Wall itself.  No one's used 
                   it in centuries most likely.  It leads 
                   through the Wall right down into the 
                   Nightfort, if one knows how to find it, 
                   which, it just so happens, I do.

           The Hound rides the horse along the road with Arya.  He then 
           stops the horse.  Arya and The Hound see a man fixing his wagon 
           at the side of the road.  The Hound gets off the horse.  He then 
           carries Arya and puts her down.

           The Hound takes the leash of the horse and hands it to Arya.  He 
           then walks towards the man fixing the wheels of his wagon.

                   My uncle said the gates were sealed 
                   with ice and stone when the castles

           horse.

           Edmure takes off his cloak and puts it on Roslin.  Roslin looks 
           at Robb.  Robb looks at Walder who makes a face at him.  The 
           Septon starts the ceremony.

                   Of course you can.  North of the Wall 
                   there are Wildlings who can control all

           and spreads out the flag of Yunkai.

                   It's a tradition.  Without the bedding 
                   ceremony, there's no real proof the 
                   lord and lady consummated their

                   know what we should name him.
