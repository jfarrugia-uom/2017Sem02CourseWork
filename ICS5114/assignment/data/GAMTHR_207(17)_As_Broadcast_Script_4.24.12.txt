           Theon awakes, finding himself alone in bed.  He starts, 
           sensing something is wrong. 
                    
           EXT.  WINTERFELL COURTYARD - DAWN. 
                    
           Several Ironborn stand around the body of a slain guard.  
           Theon stares at Black Lorren. 
                    
                          THEON  
                   A cripple!   You let a cripple escape?  
                   The boy can’t walk.  But somehow he 
                   slipped past you?   
                    
                          BLACK LORREN  
                   The giant must have took him.   
                    
                          THEON  
                   The giant?  Hodor?  Oh, well that’s all 
                   right then.  You let a halfwit escape 
                   with a cripple.  And Rickon, too, the 
                   little one?   
                    
                          BLACK LORREN  
                   Gone.  Along with the wildling woman.  
                   The one you were fucking.   
                    
           Theon's eyes widen.  He spins and hits Black Lorren with all 
           his might, dropping the man to the ground.  Wincing and 
           flexing his hand, he follws up with kick after kick.

           Theon, Dagmer, Luwin and the search party tear through the 
           woods on horseback, following the hounds and their handlers.  
           They halt to search for a scent.

                   (to Luwin)  
                   Enjoying your first hunt?   
                    
                          LUWIN  
                   Thus far hunting seems quite similar to 
                   riding, my lord.   
                    
                          THEON  
                   With hunting, there’s blood at the end.   
                    
                          LUWIN  
                   They’re little boys. 
                    
                          THEON  
                   I was a little boy when I was torn away 
                   from my home and brought here.  But I 
                   kept my word.  I never ran away.  If I 
                   find them soon enough, I won’t hurt 
                   them.  Well, I’ll hurt them.  But I 
                   won’t kill them.   
                    
                          LUWIN  
                   Those boys are of far more value to you 
                   alive than dead.   
                    
                          THEON  
                   They have no value to me missing.

                   Robb will have sent a force to retake 
                   Winterfell by now. 
                    
                          THEON  
                   Robb’s in the Riverlands.  My sister’s 
                   in Deepwood Motte.  She’ll get here long 
                   before they do.  And Ned Stark always 
                   said five hundred men could hold 
                   Winterfell against ten thousand.   
                    
           The hounds bark and start to run.  The party prepares to 
           move out.

                   just a game.

                          BRAN  
                   Wait.  I know that farm.  I sent those 
                   two Winterfell orphans there.

                   Jack and Billy.  They’ll give us some

                   We can’t risk it.  If Theon tracks us 
                   here, he’ll torture them until he finds

                   You’ve never seen me climb a tree, 
                   little man.  He’ll be after us with 
                   hounds.  We got a good start on them, 
                   but we can’t outrun hounds forever.

           Jon pulls away from her quickly, realizing where he is.  He 
           stands, flustered. 
                    
                          YGRITTE  
                   What’s the matter?  Can’t be the first 
                   time you pressed your bone against a

           He finishes untying her, taking the lead binding her wrists. 
                    
                          JON  
                   Neither.  Both.  Move. 
                    
           They proceed into the cold, rocky terrain.

                   But I heard they get all swollen and 
                   bruised if you don’t use them.  ‘Course 
                   maybe that’s just what the lads say when 
                   they want me feeling sorry for them.  As 
                   if I’d feel sorry for them.

                   There are no women of the Night’s Watch, 
                   no.   
                    
                          YGRITTE  
                   So the lads just do it with each other?   
                    
                          JON  
                   No.

                          JON  
                   Never.  We swore an oath.   
                    
                          YGRITTE  
                   You have sheep at the Wall?   
                   (off Jon’s silence)  
                   With your hands, then?  No wonder you’re 
                   all so miserable.   
                    
                          JON  
                   Would you please shut up?   
                    
                          YGRITTE  
                   (imitating him)  
                   Would you please shut up?   
                   (beat)  
                   You think you’re better than me, crow?  
                   I’m a free woman... 
                    
                   Jon tugs on the rope leash.   
                    
                          JON  
                   You’re a free woman?   
                    
                          YGRITTE  
                   Well, I might be your prisoner but I’m a 
                   free woman. 
                    
                          JON  
                   If you’re my prisoner you’re not a free 
                   woman.  That’s what prisoner means.   
                    
                          YGRITTE  
                   And you think you’re free?  You swore 
                   some stupid oath and now you can never 
                   touch a girl?

                          JON  
                   It was my choice to say the words.   
                    
                          YGRITTE  
                   So you don’t like girls. 
                    
                          JON  
                   Of course I like girls.

                   That’s the price you pay, if you want to 
                   be a man of the Night’s Watch.   
                    
                          YGRITTE  
                   So instead of getting naked with a girl 
                   you’d prefer to invade our lands and... 
                    
                          JON  
                   (angry)  
                   Invade your lands?  Wildlings raid our 
                   lands all the time.  Some of them tried 
                   to kill my little brother, a crippled 
                   boy! 
                    
                          YGRITTE  
                   (angry)  
                   They’re not your lands.  We’ve been here 
                   the whole time.  You lot came along and 
                   just put up a big wall and said it was 
                   yours! 
                    
                          JON  
                   My father was Ned Stark.  I have the 
                   blood of the First Men.  My ancestors 
                   lived here, same as yours.   
                    
                          YGRITTE  
                   So why are you fighting us?   
                    
           Jon doesn't have an answer.  Ygrite walks away to the length 
           of her lead, then Jon follows.

           EXT.  HARRENHAL - COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS. 
                    
           A number of bodies lie on the ground, while others dangle 
           from nooses.  The camera pulls back to reveal the vista 
           through a Harrenhall window.

           Tywin stands by the window, observing.  He examines the dart 
           in his hand, sniffing at the point.

                   Wolfsbane.  A rare substance.  This is 
                   no common assassin.   
                    
           The Mountain stands nearby, impassive. 
                    
                          THE MOUNTAIN  
                   We hanged twenty men last night. 
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   I don’t care if you hanged a hundred.  A 
                   man tried to kill me.  I want his name 
                   and I want his head.   
                    
                          THE MOUNTAIN  
                   We think it was an infiltrator from the 
                   Brotherhood without Banners. 
                    
           Arya enters with a tray, providing refreshments.  She busies 
           herself in the background listening. 
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   Pretentious name for a band of outlaws.  
                   We can’t allow rebels behind our lines 
                   to harass us with impunity.  We look 
                   like fools and they look like heroes.  
                   That’s how kings fall.  I want them 
                   dead, every one. 
                    
           Arya picks up the knife from the table, considering it. 
                    
                          THE MOUNTAIN  
                   Killing them isn’t the problem.  It’s 
                   finding them.   
                    
      01:09:58 
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   Have you gone soft, Clegane?  I always 
                   thought you had a talent for violence.  
                   Burn the villages.  Burn the farms.  Let 
                   them know what it means to choose the 
                   wrong side.   
                    
           The Mountain nods and exits.  Tywin glances at the rencher 
           on the table.   
                     
                          TYWIN  
                   Is that mutton?

                          TYWIN

                   I’ll bring something else.   
                    
           She starts to remove the trenchers.   
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   Leave it.  You hungry?

                          TYWIN  
                   Course you are.  Eat.   
                    
                          ARYA  
                   I’ll...  eat in the kitchen, later.   
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   It’s bad manners to refuse a lord’s 
                   offer.  Sit.  Eat.   
                    
           Arya sits.  Tywin watches until she stabs a hunk of mutton 
           and starts chewing.   
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   You’re small for your age.  I suppose 
                   you’ve been underfed your whole life.   
                    
                          ARYA  
                   I eat a lot.  I just don’t grow.

           Arya looks at him, knife in hand.

           Tywin glances back at her and Arya quickly dips her knife 
           into the trencher, munching innocently.   
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   Do you think I’d be in my position if 
                   I’d lost a war?   
                    
           Arya shakes her head.  Tywin turns back to the window.  Arya 
           stares at his neck intently, the knife in her hand. 
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   But this is the one I’ll be remembered 
                   for.  The War of Five Kings, they’re 
                   calling it.   
                   (looking out the window)  
                   Nothing matters but how it ends.  My 
                   legacy will be determined in the coming 
                   months.   
                   (glancing at Arya)

           Arya shakes her head. 
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   It’s what you pass down to your 
                   children, and your children’s children.  
                   It’s what remains of you when you are 
                   gone.  Harren the Black thought this 
                   castle would be his legacy.  Greatest 
                   fortress ever built.  The tallest 
                   towers, the strongest walls.  The Great 
                   Hall had thirty-five hearths.  Thirty-
                   five, can you imagine?  Look at it now.  
                   A blasted ruin.  Do you know what 
                   happened?

                   attack from the land.  A million men 
                   could have marched on these walls, and a 
                   million men would have been repelled.  
                   But an attack from the air?  With 
                   dragonfire?  Harren and all his sons 
                   roasted alive within these walls.  Aegon 
                   Targaryen changed the rules.  That’s why 
                   every child alive still knows his name, 
                   three hundred years after his death.   
                    
                          ARYA  
                   Aegon and his sisters.   
                    
           Tywin pauses, the goblet at his lips, considering Arya. 
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   Hmm?   
                    
                          ARYA  
                   It wasn’t just Aegon riding his dragon.  
                   It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.

                          TYWIN  
                   Correct.  A student of history, are you?   
                    
                          ARYA  
                   Rhaenys rode Meraxes.  Visenya rode 
                   Vhagar.   
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   I’m sure I knew that when I was a boy.   
                    
                          ARYA  
                   Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.  
                   She had a Valyrian steel sword she 
                   called Dark Sister.   
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   Hmm.  She’s a heroine of yours, I take 
                   it?  Aren’t most girls more interested

                   Where did you learn all this, about 
                   Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?   
                    
           Arya looks away. 
                    
                          ARYA  
                   From my father.   
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   He was a well-read stone mason.  Can’t 
                   say I’ve ever met a literate stone 
                   mason.   
                    
                          ARYA  
                   Have you met many stone masons, my lord?   
                    
      01:14:04 
                    
           Tywin smiles at her.   
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   Careful now, girl.  I enjoy you but be 
                   careful.  Take that back  
                   to the kitchen.  Eat what you want.   
                    
           Arya picks up the platter and heads for the door.   
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   And girl.   
                    
           Arya stops at the doorway, laden down with the platter.   
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   “M’lord.”  
                    
           Arya looks back, unsure what he’s talking about.   
                    
                          TYWIN  
                   Low-born girls say “m’lord.” Not “my 
                   lord.” If you’re going to pose as a 
                   commoner, you should do it properly.   
                    
                          ARYA  
                   My mother served Lady Dustin for many 
                   years.  My lord.  She taught me how to 
                   speak proper.

                          SANSA  
                   I beg pardon, ser.  I should have come 
                   to you after, to thank you for saving 
                   me.  You were so brave.

                   chase off rats.   
                    
                          SANSA  
                   Does it give you joy to scare people?

                   No, it gives me joy to kill people.  
                   Spare me.  You can’t tell me Lord Eddard 
                   Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.

                   we’re free.  Someone tried to tell us we 
                   couldn’t lie down as man and woman, we’d 
                   shove a spear up his ass.  We don’t go

                   wanted to be free.  You know, you could 
                   be free, too.  You don’t need to live 
                   your whole life taking commands from old

                   Ser Alton, we’d all hang.   
                    
                          ALTON  
                   She tore the paper in half, your Grace.

                   You’ve acted with honor.  I thank you

                   (to Karstark)  
                   Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton’s pen 
                   is clean and give him a hot supper.   
                    
                          KARSTARK  
                   Ser Alton’s pen is occupied, your Grace.  
                   The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.   
                    
                          ROOSE BOLTON  
                   Too many prisoners.   
                    
                          ROBB  
                   Is there room for Ser Alton?   
                    
                          KARSTARK  
                   Does he need to lie down?   
                    
                          ROBB  
                   Have the men build him a new pen.  Put 
                   him in with the Kingslayer for now.  
                   Have your boy watch over them.

                   Your Grace.  A minute of your time?  
                   I’ve been treating your wounded men.   
                    
                          ROBB  
                   And my enemies, as some of my bannermen 
                   are fond of mentioning.   
                    
                          TALISA  
                   They are not my enemies.   
                    
                          ROBB  
                   That’s what I tell my bannermen.   
                    
                          TALISA  
                   I’ve already run through the supplies I 
                   brought with me.  Some are easily 
                   replaced: egg yolks, turpentine, oil of 
                   roses.   
                    
                          ROBB  
                   But some are not.   
                    
           Robb walks toward her as she speaks. 
                    
                          TALISA  
                   I need silk for stitching.  I need 
                   fennel root for those with fever.  
                   Willow bark.  Mostly I need milk of the 
                   poppy.  You saw what it was like to 
                   amputate a foot without any.   
                   (beat)  
                   I assume there will be more loss of limb 
                   before this war is over.   
                    
                          ROBB  
                   If you need help finding these... 
                    
                          TALISA  
                   I know where to find them.  I’m sorry.  
                   I shouldn’t interrupt you.   
                    
           Robb smiles at her.

                   Continue, my lady.

                   We could start the search fresh in the

                   I’m looking at spending the rest of my 
                   life being treated like a fool and a 
                   eunuch by my own people.  Ask yourself, 
                   is there anything I wouldn’t do to stop 
                   that from happening?  The hounds will 
                   find the scent again, I’ll beat them 
                   until they do.  I’ll whip every man here 
                   until I have both those boys in hand.  
                   And once I’ve got them, the pampered 
                   little shits...   
                   (beat)  
                   It’s better to be cruel than weak.

           Theon delivers a sharp punch to the man’s stomach.

           Theon moves to hit him again, but Dagmer speaks up.

                   My lord.  Over here.   
                    
           Theon walks over to where he's standing. 
                    
                          DAGMER (CONT'D) 
                   I think I’ve found what we’re looking 
                   for.   
                    
           Dagmer hands Theon a couple of cracked walnut shells.  Theon 
           glances over at Luwin.

           Two of the Ironborn roughly escort Luwin back to his horse.

           She walks toward him, drawing in the leash.  They stand very 
           close for a moment, and then Jon's hand goes to the hilt of 
           his sword.  Ygritte relents.   
                    
                          YGRITTE  
                   All right, all right...  Gods, you’re 
                   dull.   
                    
           She steps backward, nonchalantly, then jerks away, pulling 
           the leash from Jon's unwary hand.  He falls as she sprints 
           away across the ice.  Jon rises to his feet and tears after 
           her as she disappears over a rise.  Jon follows, finding the 
           end of her leash lying on the ice.  He picks it up, then 
           hears a sharp whistle.  He looks up to see Ygritte rise from 
           a hiding place, followed by several wildlings.

           EXT.  KING’S LANDING - STREET - DAY. 
                    
           Sansa relives her assault, the men swarming over her, 
           tearing at her clothes, forcing her to the ground.  The 
           leering man draws a dagger this time, and she screams as he 
           plunges it home.

           Sansa awakes with a start, gasping.  She looks around the 
           bedroom, realizing she's safe, before a look of apprehension 
           clouds her face.  She throws aside the bedclothes, pulls up 
           her nightdress, and sees blood on her thighs.   
                    
                          SANSA  
                   No!  Oh no...

           She shifts, revealing a bloodstain on the sheets.  
           Horrified, she goes to the side table for a knife, then 
           returns and begins to try to cut the stain out of the

           understands. 
                    
                          SHAE  
                   It’s all right.  Give me that. 
                    
                   Shae takes the knife.

                   Help me flip it over.   
                    
           They begin to flip the mattress, but another handmaiden 
           enters, catching them in the act.  Sansa and Shae stare at 
           her for a long beat.  The handmaiden rushes from the room.  
           Shae bolts after her.

                   To tell her Grace. 
                    
           Shae grabs the girl by the throat, slams her against the 
           wall and presses the knife up to her jugular.   
                    
                          SHAE  
                   You’ll say nothing to anyone.  Do you 
                   understand?   
                    
           The handmaiden nods, terrified.  Shae lets her go and 
           watches her scurry away.  Then she hurries back to Sansa.

                   Your mother might have prepared you.

                   My mother told me, but I thought it 
                   would be different.

           Sansa walks away from her.

                   A prospect that once delighted you, 
                   bringing little princes and  
                   princesses into the world.  The greatest 
                   honor, for a queen.   
                    
           Sansa nods.  She is unable even to feign excitement.  
           Cersei, for once, goes easy on the girl.  A rare moment of 
           sympathy.

                   Robert was hunting.  That was his 
                   custom.  Whenever my time was near, my 
                   royal husband would flee to the trees 
                   with his huntsmen and his hounds.  And 
                   when he returned he would present me 
                   with some pelts or a stag’s head, and I 
                   would present him with a baby.  Not that 
                   I wanted him there, mind you.  I had 
                   Grand Maester Pycelle an army of 
                   midwives, and I had my brother.  When 
                   they told Jaime he was not allowed in 
                   the birthing room, he smiled and asked 
                   which of them proposed to keep him out.   
                   (beat)  
                   Joffrey will show you no such devotion.

                   You may never love the king, but you 
                   will love his children.

                   me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with 
                   you on this very special day.  The more

                   you shouldn’t do, you’ll act the fool to 
                   make them happy, to keep them safe.  
                   Love no one but your children.  On that

                                              “A Man Without Honor” 
                                                            
                   (beat)  
                   I remember you.  You’d never squired for 
                   anyone before.   
                    
                          ALTON  
                   That’s right.  I ran up and volunteered.  
                   You know, “Let me, my lord, let me!” My 
                   father was furious, afraid I'd embarrass 
                   our family in front of the Family.   
                    
      01:34:03 
                    
                          JAIME  
                   You didn’t, though.   
                    
                          ALTON  
                   You really remember?   
                    
                          JAIME  
                   Mm-hmm.  You knew when you were needed 
                   and when to go away.  It’s a rare 
                   talent.  Most of my squires, they mean 
                   well, but young men with big jobs, they 
                   tend to overdo them.   
                    
                          ALTON  
                   Well, when I think back to that day... 
                    
           The Karstark guard is back, glaring at them through the 
           dark.   
                    
                          KARSTARK’S SON  
                   Shh! 
                     
           Jaime stares at the man until he leaves. 
                    
                          JAIME  
                   You were saying.   
                    
                          ALTON  
                   I...  never mind.  It’s embarrassing.   
                    
                          JAIME  
                   More embarrassing than being chained to 
                   a post and covered in your own shit?   
                    
                          ALTON  
                   I remember everything about that day.

                                              “A Man Without Honor” 
                                                            
                   in the dirt along the list.  Where the 
                   sun was in the sky when you knocked 
                   Balon Swann from his horse, and the dent 
                   in your shield when you handed it back 
                   to me...  I’ll remember it all until I 
                   die.  It was the best day of my life.   
                   (beat)  
                   And I remember standing on the field 
                   after it was over.  All the competitors 
                   were done, I was the last one out 
                   there...  but I couldn’t leave.  I 
                   couldn’t bring myself to go sit with my 
                   family, at a table so far on the edge of 
                   the feast you could barely even see the  
                   bride.  And I couldn’t bear to tell them 
                   what it had been like squiring for you, 
                   when I knew that they could never have 
                   the faintest idea what I was talking 
                   about.

                   How could you?

                   it’s just I... 
                    
                          JAIME  
                   I was sixteen, once.  I also had to 
                   replace someone’s squire on short 
                   notice.

                   Which knight was it?

                   (beat)  
                   I couldn’t imagine being able to fight 
                   like that, not back then.  And  
                   to help him do it, to play a role in 
                   something that perfect...  I don’t need 
                   to explain how that felt.  Not to you.   
                    
                          ALTON  
                   It’s hard to put into words.   
                    
                          JAIME  
                   It’s like stepping into a dream you’ve 
                   been dreaming for as long as you can 
                   remember, and finding out the dream is 
                   more real than your life.  Leaving that 
                   battlefield was like being dragged off 
                   to prison.   
                    
                          ALTON  
                   Did you squire for him again?   
                    
      01:36:59 
                    
                          JAIME  
                   No.  I didn’t have your gift.  He 
                   couldn't take a step without stepping on 
                   me.  I was awful, a complete 
                   liability...   
                   (beat)  
                   Until one of the outlaws decided to take 
                   on a sixteen-year-old squire.   
                    
           The two men grin at each other. 
                    
                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   It’s a good thing I am who I am.  I’d 
                   have been useless at anything  
                   else.   
                   (beat) 
                   I’m not well suited for imprisonment.  
                   Shocking, I know.  Some men are, Ned 
                   Stark, I imagine he made an excellent 
                   prisoner right up until the end.  Not 
                   me, though.  My life has left me 
                   uniquely unfit for constraint.   
                    
                          ALTON  
                   Then have you thought about...

           Alton leans in closer.

                   Of course.  Every day.   
                    
                          ALTON  
                   And?   
                    
                          JAIME  
                   Good prisoners breed good jailers, 
                   apparently.  The Starks are very  
                   careful.   
                   (low)  
                   There is a way, I think.  It wasn’t 
                   possible until now.   
                    
                          ALTON  
                   What is it?   
                    
           Jaime moves toward Alton as the guard approaches. 
                    
                          JAIME  
                   It’s actually quite simple. 
                    
                          ALTON  
                   Well, let me help you.   
                    
                          JAIME  
                   You’ll only have to do one thing.   
                    
                          ALTON  
                   Tell me.   
                    
           Jaime leans in to whisper. 
                    
                          JAIME  
                   You’ll have to die.   
                    
           The two men look at each other for a moment, Alton 
           uncomprehending, and then Jaime head-butts him savagely.  He 
           then begins to beat Alton to death with his manacles.  The 
           guard races over, surveying the twitching corpse, giving 
           Jaime the opportunity to wrap his chains around the guard's 
           neck.

           taught until the man's neck breaks.  Swiftly, he grabs the

           Jorah enters to see Quaithe painting temporary tattoos on 
           the back of a naked man lying motionless on a table.  She 
           doesn't look up.

           Jorah opens his mouth but no words come out.  Quaithe stares 
           at him again. 
                    
                          QUAITHE (CONT'D)

                   Never.   
                    
           Quaithe watches him for a moment longer.  She seems 
           satisfied with his answer.  She goes back to her painting. 
                    
                          QUAITHE  
                   The thief you seek is with her now.

                   No one is calling you a thief.

                   will bring the world nothing but death 
                   and misery, my dear.  If I knew where 
                   they were, I would not tell you.   
                    
                          PYAT PREE  
                   (to the Spice King) 
                   You are cruel, my friend.  The Mother of 
                   Dragons is in the right.  She must be 
                   reunited with her babies.   
                   (beat)  
                   I will help you, khaleesi.   
                    
                          DANY  
                   How?   
                    
                          PYAT PREE  
                   I will take you to the House of the 
                   Undying.  Where I have put them.   
                    
           Danaerys looks astonished. 
                    
                          DANY  
                   You have my dragons.   
                    
                          PYAT PREE  
                   When I learned you were coming to our 
                   city, I made an arrangement with the 
                   King of Qarth.  He procured them for me.   
                    
                          DANY  
                   There is no King of Qarth.   
                    
                          XARO  
                   There is now.  That was the other half 
                   of the arrangement.   
                    
           Daenerys looks at him in shock. 
                    
                          XARO  
                   You would keep your gates and your minds 
                   closed to everything outside your walls.  
                   But Qarth cannot remain the greatest 
                   city that ever was if it refuses to 
                   change.  I will open Qarth to the world, 
                   as I have forced it to open itself to 
                   me.   
                    
           Slowly, Dany backs away.  Pyat Pree moves to stand behind 
           Xaro.

                          SPICE KING  
                   Your ambition is an inspiration.  But 
                   like all upstarts, you overreach.  Three 
                   dragons the size of cats and an alliance 
                   with a charlatan do not make you a king.   
                    
                          XARO  
                   An upstart and a charlatan?  Empires 
                   have been built by less.  Those on the 
                   margins often come to control the 
                   center.  And those in the center make 
                   room for them, willingly or otherwise.   
                    
                          PYAT PREE  
                   The Mother of Dragons will be with her 
                   babies.  She will give them her love and 
                   they will thrive by her side.   
                    
           Figures step up behind each of the remaining members of the 
           Thirteen. 
                    
                          PYAT PREE (CONT'D) 
                   Forever.   
                    
           Each of the figures draws a dagger, slitting the throat of 
           the member in front of him in unison.  Daenerys realizes 
           that they are all Pyat Pree.  She runs, followed by Kovarro.  
           She rounds a corner and a Pyat Pree leers at her, blue lips 
           twisted in an approximation of a smile.   
                    
      01:43:11 
                    
           Suddenly, a sword blade erupts from his chest.  Jorah holds 
           the sword.  The Pyat Pree smiles. 
                    
                          PYAT PREE  
                   A mother should be with her children. 
                    
           Jorah pulls free his sword and the Pree’s empty cloak 
           flutters to the floor.  With his free hand, Jorah takes 
           Dany’s hand and leads her away.  Another Pree appears before 
           them.   
                    
                          PYAT PREE  
                   Where will you run, Daenerys Stormborn?  
                   Your dragons wait for you in the House

           Catelyn sits at her table, writing a letter.  A Stark man 
           burts into the tent, only to be barred by Brienne.

           The crowd begins to beat Jaime.  He falls, is dragged to his 
           feet, falls again.  Lord Karstark approaches.

           Catelyn rushes into the clearing.

                   Crag to accept the surrender. 
                     
                          LORD KARSTARK  
                   Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to 
                   negotiate.  He brought that foreign 
                   bitch with him. 
                    
                          CATELYN  
                   How dare you? 
                    
           Brienne draws her sword.   
                    
                          BRIENNE  
                   Threatening my lady is an act of 
                   treason! 
                    
                          LORD KARSTARK  
                   Treason?  How can it be treason to kill 
                   Lannisters?   
                    
                          CATELYN  
                   I understand your grief, my lord.  
                   Better than most, I understand it.  But 
                   in the name of my son, the King in the 
                   North, stand down.   
                    
                          LORD KARSTARK  
                   When your son returns, I will demand 
                   this murderer’s head. 
                    
                          CATELYN  
                   Wise men do not make demands of kings. 
                    
                          LORD KARSTARK  
                   Fathers who loved their sons do.  I will 
                   have his head.   
                    
           Karstark storms off, followed by his men. 
                    
                          JAIME  
                   Thank you for fighting on my behalf, 
                   Lady Stark.  I would have come to your 
                   defense, but...

                          TYRION  
                   I’d call it tactics, not strategy.  But 
                   yes, he does have a good mind for it.  
                   The best mind, some would say.  Sadly, 
                   he’s not here.  It’s just you, me and

      01:49:58 
                    
           EXT.  STARK CAMP - STOCKADE - NIGHT.   
            
           Catelyn approaches Jaime, who is manacled at ankles and 
           wrists and chained tightly to a post, attended by guards. 
                    
                          CATELYN  
                   I need to be alone with him.   
                    
                          STARK GUARD  
                   (hesitating)  
                   My lady, our orders... 
                    
                          CATELYN  
                   Your orders, which I just gave you, are 
                   to leave me alone with him.   
                    
           The guards walk away.  Jaime looks up at Catelyn. 
                    
                          JAIME  
                   Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?  I 
                   believe it’s my last night in this 
                   world.   
                    
           He seems quite cheerful about it.  He squints at Brienne.   
                    
                          JAIME  
                   Is that a woman?   
                    
                          CATELYN  
                   Do you hear them out there?  They want 
                   your head.   
                    
                          JAIME  
                   Old Lord Karstark doesn’t seem to like 
                   me.

                                              “A Man Without Honor” 
                                                            
                          CATELYN  
                   You strangled his son with your chains.   
                    
                          JAIME  
                   Oh, oh, was he the one on guard duty?  
                   He was in my way.  Any knight would have 
                   done the same.   
                    
                          CATELYN  
                   You are no knight.  You’ve forsaken 
                   every vow you ever took. 
                    
      01:51:02 
                    
                          JAIME  
                   So many vows.  They make you swear and 
                   swear.  Defend the king.  Obey the king.  
                   Obey your father.  Protect the innocent.  
                   Defend the weak.   
                   (beat)  
                   Well, what if your father despises the 
                   king?  What if the king massacres the 
                   innocent?  It’s too much.  No matter 
                   what you do, you’re forsaking one vow or 
                   another.   
                   (glancing at Brienne)  
                   Where did you find this beast?   
                    
                          CATELYN  
                   She is a truer knight than you’ll ever 
                   be, Kingslayer.   
                    
                          JAIME  
                   Kingslayer.  What a king he was!  Here's 
                   to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of his 
                   Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, 
                   Protector of the Realm!  And to the 
                   sword I shoved in his back.   
                    
                          CATELYN  
                   You are a man without honor.   
                    
                          JAIME  
                   Do you know I’ve never been with any 
                   woman but Cersei?  So in my own way, 
                   I’ve had more honor than poor old dead 
                   Ned.  What was the name of that bastard 
                   he fathered?

                          JAIME  
                   No, that wasn’t it.  Snow.  A bastard 
                   from the North.  Now when, when good old 
                   Ned came home with some whore’s baby, 
                   did you pretend to love it?  No, you’re 
                   not very good at pretending.  You’re an 
                   honest woman.  You hated that boy, 
                   didn’t you?  How could you not hate him?  
                   The walking, talking reminder that the 
                   honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked 
                   another woman.   
                    
           Catelyn holds out her hand to Brienne.   
                    
                          CATELYN  
                   Your sword.   
                    
           Brienne draws her blade. 
                    
           EXT.  WINTERFELL - COURTYARD - DAY. 
                    
           Theon paces in front of the occupants of Winterfell. 
                    
                          THEON  
                   I told you what would happen.  All of 
                   you.  I told you what would happen if 
                   you served me loyally, and what would 
                   happen if you did not.   
                    
      01:53:16 
                    
           Two Ironborn drag Luwin before Theon. 
                    
                          LUWIN  
                   What are you doing?  What have you done? 
                    
                          THEON  
                   So if there are any among you who still 
                   question whether your new lord means 
                   what he says... 
                    
           But then Luwin follows the gazes of the Winterfell 
           occupants.

                   Here is the answer to your question.   
                    
           Luwin’s face goes slack with dread as he sees the burned and 
           mutilated bodies of two boys being hoisted on ropes above 
           the gates of Winterfell.   
                    
                          LUWIN 
                   (screaming) 
                   No! 
                    
           Theon looks at the corpses, then at the ground.
