           Tilt up on sword in stone. Tywin’s hands pull sword from sheath.

           Tywin stands before fire admiring sword. Swordsmith takes the sword and 
           begins hammering the sword on anvil in the fire. 
         
           Molten metal pours into a mold of two swords.  Tywin picks up the sheath and 
           drops it into the fire. He watches it burn.

           Jaime admires sword.

                   Magnificent. 
         
        01:03:48:18 
                         TYWIN 
                   Mm-hmm. 
         
        01:03:49:09 
                         TYWIN 
                   Looks fresh-forged. 
         
        01:03:51:15   
                         TYWIN 
                   It is.

                   No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since 
                   the Doom of Valyria. 
         
           Tywin walks to his desk and sits.

                         TYWIN 
                   There are three living smiths who know 
                   how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of 
                   them was in Volantis. Came here to King's 
                   Landing at my invitation. 
         
        01:04:07:12 
                         JAIME 
                   Where did you get this much Valyrian  
                   steel? 
         
        01:04:09:18   
                         TYWIN 
                   From someone who no longer had need  
                   of it. 
         
        01:04:14:16   
                         JAIME 
                   You've wanted one of these in the family  
                   for a long time. 
         
        01:04:17:21 
                         TYWIN 
                   And now we have two. 
         
        01:04:19:03 
                         JAIME 
                   Two? 
         
        01:04:19:17   
                         TYWIN 
                   The original weapon was absurdly large. 
                   Plenty of steel for two swords. 
         
         01:04:24:16 
                         JAIME 
                   Well, thank you. It's glorious. 
         
           Jaime tries to use sword to lift swords on table. He fails. 
         
        01:04:33:15 
                         TYWIN 
                   You'll have to train your left hand.

                         JAIME 
                   Any decent swordsman knows how to use 
                   both hands. 
         
           Jaime sits at table. 
         
        01:04:37:29 
                         TYWIN 
                   You'll never be as good. 
         
        01:04:40:02 
                         JAIME 
                   No. But as long as I'm better than 
                   everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter. 
         
        01:04:45:09 
                         TYWIN 
                   You can't serve in the Kingsguard with 
                   one hand. 
         
        01:04:48:15 
                         JAIME 
                   Where's that written? I can and I will. The    
                   Kingsguard oath is for life. 
         
        01:04:52:04 
                         TYWIN 
                   The war is over. The king is safe. 
         
        01:04:54:07   
                         JAIME 
                   The king is never safe. How many people 
                   in this city alone would love to see his head 
                   on a pike? 
         
        01:04:58:20 
                         TYWIN 
                   Other knights protected the king while you 
                   were a prisoner. They will continue to do 
                   so when you go home.

                         TYWIN 
                   You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in 
                   my stead. 
         
           Jaime sighs. 
         
        01:05:09:22 
                         JAIME 
                   You are the Lord of Casterly Rock. 
                    
           Jaime stands and walks a few steps from his chair. 
         
        01:05:13:17   
                         TYWIN 
                   I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I 
                   don't expect to see the Rock again before I 
                   die. 
         
        01:05:20:07 
                         JAIME 
                   You know what they call me? Kingslayer. 
                   Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now 
                   you want me to break another sacred vow. 
         
        01:05:29:15 
                         TYWIN 
                   You won't be breaking anything. There is a 
                   precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his 
                   duties. The king will exercise that 
                   prerogative.  
         
        01:05:38:08   
                         JAIME 
                   No. 
         
                         TYWIN 
                   No? 
         
           Jaime turns to Tywin. 
         
        01:05:40:23 
                         JAIME 
                   No. 
         
           Jaime moves toward Tywin.

                         TYWIN 
                   I don't believe I asked you a question. 
         
        01:05:46:08 
                         JAIME 
                   There's my answer. 
         
        01:05:47:12 
                         TYWIN 
                   If you think your bloody honor comes 
                   before-- 
         
        01:05:48:26   
                         JAIME 
                   (overlap) My bloody honor is beyond 
                   repair, but my answer is still no. I don't 
                   want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I 
                   don't want children. 
         
        01:05:54:28 
                         TYWIN 
                   What do you want? 
         
        01:05:57:16 
                         JAIME 
                   Supper would be nice. 
         
        01:06:01:18 
                         TYWIN 
                   For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you 
                   haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. 
                   If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the 
                   sum of your ambition, go serve. 
         
        01:06:13:25   
                         JAIME 
                   I suppose you want the sword back. 
         
        01:06:16:14 
                         TYWIN 
                   Keep it. A one-handed man with no family 
                   needs all the help he can get. 
         
           Tywin glares at Jaime, who holds his gaze, then picks up the sword and  
           strides out of the room.

           Tyrion waits in the capital city. With him stands Podrick. Bronn sits  
           against a tree.  
         
        01:06:49:19 
                         BRONN 
                   How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck 
                   a goat? 
         
        01:06:52:12   
                         TYRION 
                   Please don't. 
         
           Villagers come and go.

                         BRONN 
                   Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern.  
                   That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale 
                   inside. 
         
        01:07:04:00   
                         TYRION 
                   This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting 
                   for, not one of your sell sword friends. 
         
        01:07:08:02   
                         BRONN 
                   If he's so damned important, how come they 
                   sent you to meet him? 
         
        01:07:13:21 
                         TYRION 
                   There's bad blood between the Martells of 
                   Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. 
                   Has been for years. 
         
        01:07:19:04   
                         BRONN 
                   And just in case the Martells of Dorne are 
                   looking to spill some Lannister blood, it 
                   may as well be yours, eh?

                   No need for cynicism. I happen to be an 
                   accomplished diplomat.

                         BRONN

                         TYRION 
                   Ah, here we are. 
         
           Tyrion turns and claps his hands. 
         
        01:07:34:03 
                         TYRION 
                   Can you read the sigils? 
         
           Horses are coming. The house sigils wave. Bronn squints at them. 
         
        01:07:38:07   
                         BRONN 
                   Yellow balls? 
         
        01:07:39:21   
                         PODRICK 
                   Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt 
                   of Lemonwood.  
                    
           Bronn looks at Podrick, then back toward the sigils. 
         
        01:07:44:18 
                         PODRICK 
                   A vulture grasping a baby in its talons, 
                   House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the 
                   Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.

        01:07:52:24 
                         BRONN 
                   I need a sigil. 
         
        01:07:54:08 
                         TYRION 
                   And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a 
                   spear? 
         
             Podrick looks. 
         
        01:07:57:29   
                         PODRICK 
                   I don't see it, my lord. 
         
            Tyrion nods and steps forward to greet the riders. 
         
        01:08:03:13   
                         TYRION 
                   Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey 
                   welcomes you in his name. My lord father, 
                   the King's Hand, sends his greetings as 
                   well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly 
                   Rock, Master of Coin.  
         
            There is no response. 
         
        01:08:17:23 
                         TYRION 
                   Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in 
                   your company. 
         
        01:08:21:18 
                        BLACKMONT 
                   The prince's health forces him to remain at 
                   Sunspear. He sends his brother, Prince 
                   Oberyn, to attend the royal wedding in his 
                   stead. 
         
             Tyrion pauses. As he speaks again, he rarely makes eye contact with the guests.

                         TYRION 
                   Yes, the king would be delighted to enjoy 
                   the company of a warrior as renowned as 
                   Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast. 
         
        01:08:40:24   
                        BLACKMONT 
                   Will he? 
         
        01:08:42:01   
                         TYRION 
                   And where is Prince Oberyn? 
         
        01:08:44:28 
                        BLACKMONT 
                   Arrived before dawn. Not a man for 
                   welcome parties, our prince. 
         
           Tyrion nods, not pleased. Bronn holds back laughter. 
         
           Tyrion gestures toward Podrick and Bronn. 
         
        01:08:51:04 
                         TYRION 
                   Very well. My lords, these fine men from 
                   the City Watch will escort you to your 
                   quarters in the Red Keep. You must be 
                   weary after such a long journey. 
         
           The guests travel past Tyrion, ignoring him. Podrick  
           lowers his banner. He, Tyrion and Bronn walk back to  
           their horses. 
         
        01:09:05:03 
                         BRONN 
                   Some accomplished diplomacy that was. 
                   Now where? 
         
        01:09:09:10 
                         TYRION 
                   We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills 
                   somebody or several somebodies.

                   How do you plan on finding a single 
                   Dornishman in a city this big? 
         
        01:09:16:11 
                         TYRION 
                   You're famous for fucking half of 
                   Westeros. You just arrived at the capital 
                   after two weeks of bad roads, where would 
                   you go? 
         
        01:09:22:29 
                         BRONN 
                   I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old. 
         
           INT. -  LITTLEFINGER’S BROTHEL – DAY 
         
           Oberyn walks around a line of three whores, examining them.  Olyvar  
           stands watching. 
         
         
           Oberyn stops at the whore on the end. He turns to Ellaria who sits on settee 
           watching. 
         
        01:09:50:02 
                         OBERYN 
                   Look at this one. How lovely is she? 
         
        01:09:55:23 
                         ELLARIA 
                   Beautiful. But pale. 
         
           Oberyn strokes the whore’s hair. He rubs her chest and deftly removes her dress for 
           Ellaria to see. 
         
        01:09:59:14 
                         OBERYN 
                   They like them pale in the capital. Shows 
                   they don't work the fields. Do I frighten 
                   you?  
         
           The whore shakes her head, but continues to look at the  
           ground. Oberyn looks back to Ellaria.

                    OBERYN 
                   You like? 
         
        01:10:11:28 
                         ELLARIA 
                   Timid. Timid bores me. 
         
        01:10:15:19 
                         OBERYN 
                   Hmm. 
         
            Oberyn looks at Marei. He walks to her. The first whore picks up her gown and 
            dresses herself. 
         
        01:10:20:28 
                         OBERYN 
                   You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?  
         
           Oberyn turns to Ellaria, smiling. 
         
        01:10:26:06 
                    OBERYN 
                   I think she likes you. (chuckles) 
         
        01:10:27:23   
                         ELLARIA 
                   (overlap) She has good taste. 
         
        01:10:31:24   
                         OBERYN 
                   You're not timid, are you? 
         
           Oberyn removes her gown and strokes her buttocks. Marei moves forward,  
           swinging her hips to Ellaria. She pulls her ankle from behind her to the back  
           of her head. 
         
        01:10:37:20   
                         ELLARIA 
                   (laughs) Not timid. 
         
           Marei leans closer to Ellaria. Oberyn sits on settee with Ellaria.

                   Do you like women? 
         
        01:10:42:15 
                         MAREI 
                   When they look like her, my lord. 
         
           Ellaria plays with Marei’s breasts. 
         
        01:10:44:11   
                         ELLARIA 
                   This one will do nicely.

                   Very good, my lady. 
         
           Ellaria looks at Olyvar. 
         
        01:10:48:21 
                         ELLARIA 
                   Oh, I'm not a lady. 
         
        01:10:51:00   
                         OLYVAR 
                   A term of courtesy in this establishment. 
         
        01:10:53:08 
                         ELLARIA 
                   A lie anywhere. Why not use the right 
                   words? I'm a bastard. She is a whore. And 
                   you're what? A procurer.

                   offer.  
                    
           Oberyn pours himself a drink. 
         
        01:11:19:27 
                         OBERYN 
                   Take off your clothes. We'll be here a 
                   while.

           Olyvar grins slightly. 
         
        01:11:29:13   
                         OLYVAR 
                   Can't say I have. I'm wildly expensive.

           Olyvar begins to remove his jacket. 
         
        01:11:47:22   
                         OLYVAR 
                   Which way do you like it?  
         
           Oberyn grabs Olyvar’s crotch. Olyvar stiffens.

                         OLYVAR 
                   (gasps) 
         
           Oberyn’s face is very near Olyvar’s. They look eye to eye.

                   My way.

                        MAN (singing) 
                   And so he spoke 
                   and so he spoke 
                   That Lord of Castamere  
         
           Oberyn and Ellaria turn to sound of singing 
         
        01:12:02:29 
                    OBERYN & ELLARIA (singing) 
                   And now the rains... 
         
        01:12:05:15 
                        MAN (singing) 
                   Weep o'er his hall 
         
                         ELLARIA 
                   Oberyn… Oberyn don't. 
                    
           Oberyn goes toward singing. Ellaria follows him. 
         
           INT. – LITTLEFINGER’S BROTHEL – THE NEXT ROOM – DAY 
         
           Savage sings to whore. Morgan sits with another whore. Oberyn walks in to  
           see them.

                       SAVAGE (singing) 
                   With no one there 
                   to hear 
                   Yes, not the rains 
                   weep o'er his hall 
                   And not a soul 
                   to hear 
         
           The singing stops as Savage and Female and other couple stare. Oberyn  
           walks to them. 
         
        01:12:30:27 
                         SAVAGE 
                   You lost, friend? 
         
        01:12:32:13 
                         OBERYN 
                   Forgive me for staring. I don't see many 
                   Lannisters where I'm from. 
         
        01:12:38:04 
                         SAVAGE 
                   I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital. 
         
        01:12:40:29   
                         OBERYN 
                   We don't like the smell. (laughs) 
         
           Ellaria rushes up behind Oberyn. 
         
        01:12:44:07   
                         ELLARIA 
                   Come with me, lover. 
         
                         MORGAN 
                   Gods, look at this one. 
         
           Olyvar addresses Morgan and Savage. 
         
        01:12:47:01 
                         OLYVAR 
                   Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a 
                   private room.

                         MORGAN 
                   (overlap) Why are you wasting a woman 
                   like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a 
                   shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil. 
                   (laughs) 
         
        01:12:59:07 
                         OBERYN 
                   Do you know why all the world hates a 
                   Lannister?  
         
           Oberyn moves forward. Morgan and Savage stand. The 
           whores run away. 
         
        01:13:07:27 
                         OBERYN 
                   You think your gold and…your lions and 
                   your gold lions make you better than 
                   everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're 
                   not a golden lion. You're just a pink little 
                   man who is far too slow on the draw. 
         
           Morgan and Oberyn stare. Ellaria watches. Morgan begins to 
           draw. Oberyn stabs Morgan’s hand to the table. 
         
        01:13:32:20 
                         MORGAN

                         OBERYN 
                   Longsword is a bad option in close 
                   quarters.  
                    
           Oberyn looks at Savage. 
         
        01:13:39:23 
                         OBERYN 
                   When I pull my blade, your friend starts 
                   bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many 
                   veins in the wrist. 
         
        01:13:44:10

                   So, decisions. 
         
           Savage stands with sword half drawn. 
         
        01:13:53:11 
                         MORGAN 
                   (sputters) 
         
           Tyrion, Bronn and Podrick walk into room. 
         
        01:13:55:05 
                         TYRION 
                   Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We 
                   heard there might be... 
         
           Oberyn removes the sword from Morgan’s hand and  
           turns to Tyrion. Blood spurts up from Morgan’s wrist. 
         
                         MORGAN 
                   ( screams ) 
         
        01:13:58:23   
                         TYRION 
                   ...trouble. 
         
         
           Savage pulls Morgan out door as Oberyn and Ellaria embrace. 
         
        01:14:02:02 
                         OBERYN 
                   Apologies, my love. 
         
           They kiss passionately. Bronn grins. Tyrion waits awkwardly. 
         
        01:14:09:18 
                         TYRION 
                   I'm here to welcome you to the capital. 
         
           The kissing continues.  Finally, Oberyn introduces Ellaria.

                   Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own 
                   Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.

                   more-- 
         
           Oberyn notices Bronn. 
         
        01:14:27:14 
                         OBERYN

        01:14:29:08   
                         BRONN 
                   It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight. 
         
        01:14:32:19   
                         OBERYN 
                   How did that come to pass? 
         
        01:14:34:01 
                         BRONN 
                   Killed the right people, I suppose. 
         
        01:14:37:13

                   We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes? 
         
           Bronn nods. Tyrion shakes his head. Oberyn looks at Tyrion. 
         
        01:14:44:05 
                         OBERYN

                   Oberyn, if I may, a word in private? 
         
           Ellaria ends her embrace of Oberyn and leaves room.

           Oberyn and Tyrion walk down steps and along city

                   Oh, let us speak truth here. Joffrey is 
                   insulted. I am only the second son, after all. 
         
        01:15:10:21   
                         TYRION

           They stop walking.

                         OBERYN 
                   I was invited to the royal wedding. 
         
        01:15:21:06 
                         TYRION

        01:15:25:04 
                         OBERYN 
                   The last time I was in the capital was many 
                   years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia  
                   and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. 
                   My sister loved him. She bore his children. 
                   Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at 
                   her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet 
                   nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble 
                   Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another 
                   woman. That started a war, and the war 
                   ended right here when your father's army 
                   took the city...

                         OBERYN 
                   (overlap) They butchered those children. 
                   My nephew and niece. Carved them up and 
                   wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my 
                   sister, you know what they did to her? 
         
           Tyrion is silent, looking at ground. Oberyn puts his finger on Tyrion’s chin  
           and lifts his head to look him in the eye. 
         
        01:16:21:19

                   (chuckles) Hm. So have I. The one I keep 
                   hearing is that Gregor Clegane the 
                   Mountain raped Elia and split her in half 
                   with his great sword.

                   (overlap) If the Mountain killed my sister, 
                   your father gave the order. Tell your father 
                   I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't 
                   the only ones who pay their debts. 
         
           Tyrion is uncomfortable. Oberyn walks away. Tyrion turns to watch him  
           leave.

           Daenerys sits with dragons. Some fly. One rests its head on her lap. She  
           strokes its head.

           The men drop their swords immediately. Grey Worm looks to Missandei who raises 
           her eyebrows at him slightly. She follows after Daenerys.

           Sansa stands and leaves table. 
         
        01:22:49:09   
                         SANSA 
                   Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to 
                   visit the godswood. 
         
           Tyrion stands and walks with Sansa. 
         
        01:22:52:13 
                         TYRION 
                   Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, 
                   I hear. 
         
        01:22:55:16 
                         SANSA 
                   I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I 
                   can go where people don't talk to me. 
         
           Sansa turns and leaves. Tyrion is thoughtful. 
         
         
           INT. – KING’S LANDING =- TYRION’S QUARTERS – DAY 
         
           Tyrion enters room and closes door.

                   My lion. 
         
           Tyrion turns to see Shae sitting seductively in his bed. 
         
        01:23:22:11 
                         TYRION 
                   What are you doing? 
         
        01:23:27:15 
                          SHAE 
                   What does it look like I'm doing? Come 
                   here. 
         
        01:23:31:08 
                         TYRION 
                   How many times have I told you? You can't 
                   visit me here.

           Tyrion walks toward her. 
         
        01:23:34:00   
                          SHAE 
                   (overlap) I know. I know. We have come to 
                   a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? 
                   Do you know how long it's been? 
         
        01:23:40:16 
                         TYRION 
                   Of course I haven't forgotten. 
         
           Shae puts her face to Tyrion’s face. 
         
        01:23:41:24 
                          SHAE 
                   I want you. Don't you want me? (kiss) 
         
        01:23:47:08   
                         TYRION 
                   Things are a bit tense right now. 
         
        01:23:49:19   
                          SHAE 
                   What things? 
         
           Tyrion counts the issues on his fingers. 
         
        01:23:51:28   
                         TYRION 
                   My nephew the king wants to murder me. 
                   My wife hates me because my father 
                   murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants 
                   to murder everyone whose last name is 
                   Lannister. 
         
           Shae reaches her hands between Tyrion’s legs. 
         
        01:24:00:04 
                          SHAE 
                   You need to relax. Don't you want to relax? 
         
           Tyrion pulls from Shae.

                          SHAE 
                   What's wrong? 
         
                         TYRION 
                   I told you. It's not a good time. 
         
        01:24:23:28 
                          SHAE 
                   It's never a good time. You have your child bride now. 
         
           Shae storms past Tyrion. 
         
                         TYRION 
                   Shae. 
         
        01:24:29:10 
                          SHAE 
                   Do you love her? 
         
           Shae puts her dress back on. 
         
                         TYRION 
                   Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. 
                   She despises me. 
         
        01:24:34:08 
                          SHAE 
                   That's not an answer. 
         
        01:24:36:00   
                         TYRION 
                   Of course I don't love her. 
         
           Shae puts on her jewelry. 
         
        01:24:38:07 
                          SHEA 
                   You tried to ship me away. 
         
        01:24:40:07 
                         TYRION 
                   Ship you away? 
         
           Shae turns to Tyrion.

                          SHAE 
                   Give me diamonds and make me disappear. 
         
           Tyrion walks toward Shae. 
         
        01:24:46:08 
                         TYRION 
                   What in the world are you talking about? 
         
        01:24:48:00 
                          SHAE 
                   If you want me to leave, just say it. Say it! 
         
        01:24:52:17   
                         TYRION 
                   Shh. I don't know what you're talking about. 
         
           Shae moves to Tyrion. 
         
        01:24:57:01 
                          SHAE 
                   You want me to stay? 
         
        [MUSIC IN] 
         
           Tyrion says nothing. Shae bends down to pick up her shoes. She leaves angrily. 
         
           INT. – KING’S LANDING – HALL – DAY 
         
           Shae closes Tyrion’s door and walks on. Behind a column unnoticed, a maid 
           notices. 
         
           INT. – KING’S LANDING – ROOM – DAY 
         
           Qyburn puts a fabric cloth over Jaime’s stump. He picks up a metal prosthetic had 
           and twists it onto Jaime’s sleeve. Jaime winces. Qyburn ties its straps to secure the 
           hand.

                   A work of art, really. The craftsmanship is 
                   excellent. 
         
        01:25:31:07 
                         JAIME 
                   You like it so much, you're welcome to chop 
                   off your own hand and take it. 
                    
           Cersei pours a glass of wine.

                         CERSEI 
                   Such an ingrate. I spent days with the 
                   goldsmith, getting the details just right.  
         
        01:25:38:19   
                         JAIME 
                   Days?

                         CERSEI 
                   Better part of an afternoon. 
         
        01:25:41:19   
                         QYBURN 
                   There, how does that feel? 
         
           Jaime moves the heavy prosthetic. 
         
        01:25:44:07 
                         JAIME 
                   Uh... a hook would be more practical. 
         
        01:25:48:11   
                         CERSEI 
                   Elegant, I think. 
         
        01:25:56:12 
                         CERSEI 
                   Thank you for your help with the other 
                   matter. 
                    
           As Qyburn leaves, Cersei walks with him. Jaime overhears. 
         
        01:25:57:28 
                         QYBURN

        01:25:59:09 
                         CERSEI 
                   Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester 
                   Qyburn. 
         
        01:26:01:26 
                         QYBURN 
                   Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to 
                   help whenever I can. 
         
           Qyburn smiles, then looks to Jaime, who waves slightly with his prosthetic hand.  
           Qyburn exits up the stairs. 
         
        01:26:15:06 
                         JAIME 
                   Odd little man.

                         CERSEI 
                   I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite 
                   talented, you know.  
         
        01:26:20:17   
                         JAIME 
                   What symptoms?

                         CERSEI

           Cersei pours another glass of wine.

                         JAIME 
                   You let him touch you?

                   (laughs) You think I'd let that old lecher put 
                   his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.

                   Mm. Let's see, you started a brawl in the 
                   streets with Ned Stark and disappeared 
                   from the capital. My husband died in a 
                   tragic hunting accident.

                   Rather a short siege. 
         
           Jaime stands and walks slowly to Cersei. 
         
        01:27:04:12   
                         CERSEI 
                   A rather short siege that I didn't expect to 
                   survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest 
                   son to a wicked little bitch from 
                   Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry 
                   her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So, 
                   hm... 
         
           Jaime sits next to Cersei. 
         
        01:27:15:17 
                         JAIME 
                   Father disowned me today. 
         
        01:27:18:03 
                         CERSEI 
                   He can't disown you. You're all he's got. 
         
        01:27:20:16   
                         JAIME 
                   You're forgetting Tyrion. 
         
        01:27:23:03   
                         CERSEI 
                   You don't really plan on staying in the 
                   Kingsguard, do you? 
         
           Jaime holds Cersei’s hand and puts his hand to her hair. 
         
        01:27:30:19   
                         JAIME 
                   Staying in the Kingsguard means I live 
                   right here in the Red Keep with you. 
         
           Jaime tries to kiss Cersei. She pulls away. 
         
        01:27:38:05 
                         CERSEI 
                   Not now. 
         
           Cersei stands and walks a few steps away from him.

                   Everything's changed. You come back after 
                   all this time with no apologies and one 
                   hand and expect everything to be the same?

                   could be here with you.

           Tormund walks along edge. Ygritte sits among lower rocks, feathering arrows.

                        TORMUND

        01:28:54:07 
                        TORMUND 
                   We wait for Mance's orders. 
         
        01:28:56:12

                   You sent a man over the Wall at the full

                   And what is it you want? March on Castle 
                   Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow 
                   said 1,000 men are nesting there.

                        TORMUND 
                   He is? Shouldn't it be, "He was"? You said 
                   you put three arrows in him. 
         
        01:29:16:04 
                         YGRITTE 
                   I did. 
         
        01:29:17:28   
                        TORMUND 
                   I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's 
                   eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, 
                   it's 'cause you let him go.

           Ygritte and Tormund look up at Lookout who gives a nod. The men draw their 
           swords and walk forward. 
            
           Ahead, Thenns approach 
            
           Tormund recognizes them. 
         
        01:29:50:21   
                        TORMUND 
                   Thenns. I fucking hate Thenns. 
                    
           Tormund replaces his sword. Styr grimaces at Tormund.

                   How did you find us? 
         
        Styr turns his head. Bird squawks and flies. 
         
        01:30:14:07 
                        TORMUND 
                   You came from the south, not the north. 
         
        01:30:17:06 
                          STYR 
                   Took a detour. Got some supper from a 
                   village down that way. (chuckles) Why 
                   does the meat down here taste so much 
                   better than it does on our side of the Wall? 
         
           Thenns sling a sack on ground. It appears to be a human body. Tormund indicates 
           with his hand. 
         
        01:30:30:09 
                        TORMUND 
                   Help yourself. 
         
        01:30:32:01   
                          STYR 
                   (chuckles) Maybe everything's just better fed down here. Fat  
                   and lazy.  
         
           Thenns scrape small skinned animal carcasses off of sword. 
         
           Styr walks past Tormund, patting him on the shoulder. Tormund and Ygritte follow  
           him.

                   your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?

                   She yours? 
         
           Styr nods toward Ygritte. He and Tormund turn to Ygritte. 
         
        01:31:08:24   
                         YGRITTE 
                   I'm not anybody's. 
         
           She pulls back on her bow and puts the arrow tip on Styr’s throat. Styr and his men 
           pull their swords. 
         
        01:31:20:04   
                          STYR 
                   Too scrawny. Not like those crows at 
                   Castle Black. Think of them stuck in their 
                   larders stuffing their faces with ham and 
                   blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat 
                   and marbled.  
                    
           Tormund pushes down Ygritte’s bow. 
         
        01:31:39:04 
                          STYR  
                   I know we've had our differences, 
                   Tormund, but just one time, before you die, 
                   you really ought to try crow. 
         
           Styr squats in front of before the Thenn fire. A severed arm is 
        on  
           the spit, cooking.

                   I was jealous of Robb my whole life. 
                   (winces) The way my father looked at him, 
                   I wanted that. He was better than me at 
                   everything-- fighting and hunting and

                   A shadow? 
         
        01:37:50:16 
                         BRIENNE 
                   A shadow with the face of Stannis 
                   Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it 
                   was Stannis. He plunged his sword 
                   through Renly's heart and disappeared.  
                   One day, my lady, I will avenge our king. 
         
        01:38:06:23

                   Joffrey is our king now. 
         
        01:38:09:05 
                         BRIENNE 
                   I meant no offense.  
         
        01:38:11:11 
                        MARGAERY 
                   And you've given none. 
         
           Margaery touches Brienne’s shoulder and guides her to walk onward with her. They 
           pass statue of Joffrey, portraying him as a fearless hunter.

           Joffrey stands in same pose as his statue. Behind him Jaime and Meryn discuss the 
           wedding security. Joffrey wanders, paying no attention.

                         JAIME 
                   All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of 
                   course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. 
                   Ser Preston will be stationed here beside 
                   the primary entertainment. Your Grace? 
         
           Joffrey turns to Jaime. 
         
         
        01:38:35:20 
                         JOFFREY 
                   Yes, yes, one guard at the-- the thing. Go 
                   on.

        01:38:43:08 
                         MERYN 
                   I've always guarded the king himself, my 
                   lord. Ever since your absence.

                   And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. 
         
           Joffrey wanders back to table. 
         
        01:38:50:06 
                         JOFFREY 
                   (overlap) (sighs) All very good. I don't  
                   expect any trouble.  
         
        01:38:53:02   
                         MERYN

        01:38:59:24 
                         JOFFREY 
                   By my leave. They know I saved the city. 
                   They know I won the war.

        01:39:06:18 
                         JOFFREY 
                   I broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity 
                   you weren't there to help, Uncle.

                   My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather 
                   busy. 
         
           Joffrey flips through the “Book of Brothers.”

                         JOFFREY 
                   Busy getting captured. So this is the famous 
                   "Book of Brothers"? All the great deeds of 
                   all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. 
                   The Sword of the Morning. (chuckles) Led 
                   the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. 
                   Defeated the Smiling Knight in single 
                   combat Ser Duncan the Tall. (laughs) Four 
                   pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been 
                   quite a man.

                   So they say. 
         
           Joffrey eyes Jaime. He looks back to the page. 
         
        01:39:49:23 
                         JOFFREY 
                   Ser Jaime Lannister. Hm? (chuckles) 
                   Someone forgot to write down all your

                   Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one 
                   hand? How can you protect me with that? 
         
        01:40:08:20

                   Yes, my queen. But I need to speak to you 
                   about something important. A matter of 
                   strategy.

           Daario offers Daenerys a rose. 
         
        01:41:18:07   
                         DAARIO 
                   A dusk rose. 
         
           Daenerys turns and walks away. Daario follows.

                        DAENERYS

                         DAARIO 
                   You have to know a land to rule it. Its 
                   plants, its rivers, its roads, its people. Dusk 
                   rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen 
                   knows that.  
                    
           Daenerys stops, as does Daario.

                         DAARIO 
                   Especially the slaves who have to make the 
                   tea. If you want them to follow you, you 
                   have to become a part of their world.

                   Harpy's Gold. No tea from this one. 
                   Beautiful but poisonous.

                   Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since 
                   her father was killed.  Where do you think 
                   she is? My money's on dead. There's a 
                   certain safety in death, wouldn't you say?  
                   And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister.

                   Are you sure we're not related? Ever since 
                   I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has 
                   been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe 
                   you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair 
                   for it if not the looks. 
         
           Jaime walks away.  A figure walks by. 
         
        [MUSIC IN] 
         
           As she sits in the grasses, Sansa senses someone. She begins to 
           walk back toward the castle. She hears footsteps following her. 
           When she stops, the footsteps stop.

           Sansa turns to look, but sees no one. She continues walking more urgently. A man 
           walks behind her. Sansa speeds her step. He taps her shoulder. Sansa wheels 
           around.

           Dontos reaches in his pocket and removes a necklace. He 
           offers it to Sansa. She takes it.

                   It belonged to my mother and her mother 
                   before her. House Hollard was strong once.

                          MAN 
                 Come here. 
         
        01:49:12:06 
                         WOMAN 
                 (whimpering) 
         
         
        01:49:14:12   
                          MAN 
                 Let's have a feel there. 
                  
           Hound and Arya enter. Everyone stares. A woman is being held against her will. 
         
                          MAN 
                 Leave it. 
         
           Arya shuts door. 
         
           Hound and Arya sit at far end of tavern.  Man grabs Woman. 
         
        01:49:46:17   
                          MEN

                          MAN 
                 Come here. 
         
           Innkeeper pleads with Polliver. 
         
        01:49:50:13   
                        INNKEEPER 
                 Please, she's a good girl. 
         
        01:49:52:13   
                        POLLIVER 
                 Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we 
                 may not take her with us when we're done with 
                 her. 
         
           Polliver looks toward Hound and Arya. He registers recognition. 
         
        01:50:01:06   
                        POLLIVER 
                 I know you.

           Arya quietly grabs hilt of a sword. 
         
        01:50:06:07 
                         POLLIVER 
                 You're the Hound.  
         
           Polliver stands and comes toward their table. Arya releases the 
           sword. 
         
        01:50:10:00 
                        POLLIVER 
                 Pour our new friend some ale.  
                  
           Polliver sits at Hound’s table. 
         
        01:50:16:19 
                        POLLIVER 
                 What brings you so far north? 
         
        01:50:18:13   
                         HOUND 
                 I could ask the same of you. What are you doing 
                 up here? 
         
        01:50:21:06 
                        POLLIVER 
                 Just keeping the king's peace. 
         
        01:50:22:25 
                         HOUND 
                 No need. The war's over. 
         
        01:50:24:22 
                        POLLIVER 
                 So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the 
                 Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. 
                 And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your 
                 brother. Meaning no offense. 
         
        01:50:34:12 
                         HOUND 
                 None taken.

                        POLLIVER 
                 He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he 
                 does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You 
                 spend enough time putting the hammer to 
                 people, you start to feel like a carpenter making 
                 chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And 
                 what's life without a little fun? (chuckles)  
         
           Polliver turns to Arya. 
         
        01:50:55:15 
                         POLLIVER 
                 But I don't need to tell you that, eh? 
         
        01:50:59:07   
                         HOUND 
                 She's all right. I've had better. 
         
        01:51:02:02 
                        POLLIVER 
                 (laughs) 
         
        01:51:04:29   
                        POLLIVER 
                 You know what? You should come with us. 
                 His kind, they've always got something hidden 
                 away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. 
                 Always something if you know how to make 
                 them talk. And there's plenty of him between 
                 here and King's Landing.  You could do well 
                 for yourself. We certainly have been. 
         
        01:51:28:08   
                         HOUND 
                 I'm not going to King's Landing. 
         
        01:51:30:19 
                        POLLIVER 
                 Well, think about it. We could do whatever we 
                 like wherever we go. These are the king's 
                 colors. No one's standing in his way now. 
                 Which means no one's standing in ours. 
         
        01:51:44:20 
                         HOUND 
                 Fuck the king.

        The tavern goes silent. The Hound calmly takes another drink.

                 When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail 
                 and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I 
                 didn't believe it. But here you are. 
         
        01:52:03:06   
                         HOUND 
                 Here I am. Bring me one of those chickens. 
         
        01:52:08:16   
                        POLLIVER 
                 You got money to pay for it? 
        01:52:09:21 
                         HOUND 
                 You paid for it? 
         
        01:52:10:23 
                        POLLIVER 
                 (laughs) No. But we're the king's men. So, you 
                 got money? 
         
        01:52:18:15   
                         HOUND 
                 Not a penny. I'll still take that chicken. 
         
        01:52:23:07 
                        POLLIVER 
                 Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little 
                 chickens for one of yours.  
         
           Polliver looks at Arya. 
         
        01:52:30:16 
                        POLLIVER 
                 Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes 
                 them a bit broken in.

                         HOUND 
                 You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me 
                 thirsty. 
         
           Hound takes Polliver’s drink and drinks it dry. 
         
        01:53:04:25   
                         HOUND 
                 Ah. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens. 
         
           Polliver looks behind him. 
         
        01:53:20:28   
                        POLLIVER 
                 You don't seem to understand the situation. 
         
        01:53:23:18 
                         HOUND 
                 I understand that if any more words come 
                 pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have 
                 to eat every fucking chicken in this room. 
         
        01:53:32:20   
                        POLLIVER 
                 You lived your life for the king. You're gonna 
                 die for some chickens?

                 Someone is. 
         
           All are still. Polliver begins to draw. Hound and Arya flip the table. Arya watches 
           as Hound battles and beats the men in the tavern.

           A man crawls to sword on the floor. A foot steps on it before he can grab it. He 
           looks up and Hound slugs him in jaw. Hound continues battling men as Arya 
           watches.

           Men are attempting to get up from ground, struggling.
