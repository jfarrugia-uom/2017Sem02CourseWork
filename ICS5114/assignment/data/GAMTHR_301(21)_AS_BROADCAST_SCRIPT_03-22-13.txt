           sitting in front of Tormund carrying his axe.

                   What do we want with a baby Crow? 
           Tormund continues eating.

                   He wants to be one of us. 
           Tormund puts his food on the table, stands up and walks 
           towards Jon Snow.

                          TORMUND 
                   That half-handed cunt killed friends of

                          TORMUND 
                   Plenty of little men tried to put their 
                   swords through my heart.  And there's 
                   plenty of little skeletons... 
                          TORMUND (CONT'D - OS)

                   Jon Snow. 
           Jon Snow gets down on one knee before Tormund.

           Tormund faces Mance. 
                          TORMUND (CONT'D - OS) 
                   From now on...

                   ...you'd better kneel every time I

                   for anyone... 
           Jon Snow stands up. 
                          MANCE (CONT'D) 
                   ...Beyond the Wall.  So, you're Ned 
                   Stark's bastard.  Thank you for the 
                   gift, Lord O’ Bones.  You can leave us. 
           Jon Snow looks back at Rattleshirt and Ygritte leaving the 
           tent. 
                          MANCE (CONT'D) 
                   The girl likes you.  You like her back,

                   ...and I'm glad he's dead. 
           Mance extends his hand to Jon Snow.  John Snow shakes 
           Mance's hand.  Mance then tightens his grip and pulls Jon 
           Snow closer. 
                          MANCE (CONT'D) 
                   He was my brother once.  Back when he

           The man stands up holding his axe.

                   I'll ask you one last time.

                   I saw Craster take his own baby boy and 
                   leave it in the woods.  I saw what took 
                   it.

                          JON SNOW 
                   Because when I told the Lord Commander, 
                   he already knew.  Thousands of years 
                   ago, the First Men battled the White 
                   Walkers and defeated them.  I want to

                   I will murder you, boy.

      [MUSIC IN] 
            
           INT. TYRION’S ROOM - DAY. 
            
           Tyrion walks towards the mirror at a table and picks it up.  
           He then looks at the scar on his face.  Someone knocks on 
           the door. 
                          TYRION 
                   Pod? 
      01:13:52 
                          CERSEI (OS) 
                   It's your sister.  The queen. 
           Tyrion puts the mirror back on the table, walks towards the 
           door and pulls out a small ladder.  He then steps on it to 
           open the door’s viewer and peep outside where he sees 
           Cersei with Ser Meryn and another Kingsguard standing 
           behind her. 
            
      01:14:10 
                          TYRION (OS) 
                   What are they doing here? 
      01:14:11 
                          CERSEI 
                   Protecting me, I assume.  Will you let 
                   me in?

                   No, I don't think so. 
      01:14:17 
                          CERSEI (OS) 
                   If I wanted to kill... 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   ...you, do you think I'd let a wooden 
                   door stop me? 
      01:14:28 
                          TYRION 
                   They stay... 
                          TYRION (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...outside. 
      01:14:29 
                          CERSEI 
                   I'm not afraid of you, little brother. 
           Tyrion closes the door’s viewer and pulls his small ladder 
           away.  He then grabs an axe, unlocks the door and opens it 
           for Cersei.  Cersei walks inside the room.  Tyrion closes 
           and locks the door. 
            
      01:14:47 
                          TYRION 
                   Why are you here? 
      01:14:47 
                          CERSEI 
                   I wanted to see your face. 
           Cersei leans closer to Tyrion and looks at his face. 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   They said you'd lost your nose, but 
                   it's not as gruesome as all that.

           Cersei walks away. 
            
      01:14:54 
                          TYRION 
                   The man who cut me lost more than his 
                   nose. 
           Cersei turns back to Tyrion. 
            
      01:14:57 
                          CERSEI 
                   I should hope so.  The rebels came for 
                   Joffrey's head, they lost their own.  
                   Thanks to Father. 
      01:15:05 
                          TYRION 
                   Thanks to Father. 
           Tyrion puts down his axe. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   Of course, it wasn't a rebel who 
                   tried... 
                          TYRION (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...to kill me.

                          CERSEI 
                   No?  Curious.  Bit of a comedown from 
                   chamber of the Hand. 
           Tyrion walks towards a table. 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   But then I don't suppose you need much 
                   room.

           Tyrion pours drink in his glass. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   ...made the same joke.  You must be 
                   proud to be as funny as a man whose 
                   balls brush his knees. 
      01:15:26 
                          CERSEI 
                   You're meeting father today? 
      01:15:29 
                          TYRION 
                   How do you know that? 
           Tyrion puts the pitcher on the table. 
            
      01:15:30 
                          CERSEI (OS) 
                   Because I have hundreds of spies in my 
                   employ. 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   The Master of Whisperers... 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...owes me a favor or two. 
           Tyrion drinks from the cup. 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   Father told me. 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D -OS) 
                   What do you want from him? 
      01:15:41 
                          TYRION 
                   What do I want from him?  He's my 
                   father.  Do I need...

                   ...to want something? 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any 
                   father loves his child, his baby boy.  
                   Yet he hasn't come to visit... 
                          TYRION (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...once since arriving in King's 
                   Landing.  I lay here, my face split in 
                   half... 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   ...but father never came. 
           Cersei walks towards the table where Tyrion is and sits on 
           a chair.  Tyrion walks away. 
            
      01:16:09 
                          CERSEI 
                   You're going to make me cry.

                          TYRION 
                   Why do you care what I want from him?

                          CERSEI 
                   Because you've slandered me to father 
                   before. 
      01:16:17 
                          TYRION 
                   Slandered?  When?

                          CERSEI (OS)

                          TYRION (OS) 
                   You did have your guards beat her. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   A girl of nine, I believe.

                          CERSEI (OS) 
                   I was nine, too.

                          TYRION 
                   She lost an eye, if... 
                          TYRION (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...I remember correctly.

                          CERSEI 
                   If I remember correctly, she never 
                   stole a necklace again. 
      01:16:36 
                          TYRION 
                   It's not slander if it's true.

                   You're a clever man, but you're not

                   Can't I simply visit with my beloved

                   Do you think I demanded a garland of 
                   roses every time I suffered a wound on 
                   a battlefield?  Hmm? 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   Now, I have seven kingdoms to look 
                   after and three of them are in open 
                   rebellion. 
           Tywin walks back to his desk and sits down. 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   So tell me what you want.

                   I want what is mine by right.  Jaime is 
                   your eldest son, heir to your lands and 
                   titles.  But he is a Kingsguard, 
                   forbidden from marriage or inheritance.  
                   The day Jaime put on the white cloak, 
                   he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.  
                   I am your son and lawful heir.

                   You want Casterly Rock?

                          TYRION 
                   It is mine by right.

                   (sighs) We'll find you accommodations 
                   more suited to your name... 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D - OS)

                   time is right, you will be given a

                          TYWIN (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...fit for your talents so that you

                          TYWIN (CONT'D - OS) 
                   And if you serve faithfully, you will 
                   be rewarded with a suitable wife. 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   And I would let myself be consumed by

                   ...ill-made, spiteful little creature

                   And to teach me humility, the gods have

                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   ...to watch you waddle about wearing

           Tyrion stands up and walks away. 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Oh, one more thing. 
           Tyrion stops and turns back to Tywin.

                   The next whore I catch in your bed... 
           Tyrion turns away and continue walking to leave the room.

           EXT. WATERFRONT, KING’S LANDING - DAY. 
            
           Ships are sailing at sea. 
            
      01:31:44 
                          SANSA (OS) 
                   Dorne.  It's going to Dorne. 
      01:31:47 
                          SHAE (OS) 
                   Why Dorne? 
      01:31:48 
                          SANSA (OS) 
                   It's carrying silk and it's supposed to 
                   bring back wine in exchange. 
           Sansa and Shae are sitting at the dock, watching the ships. 
                          SANSA (CONT'D) 
                   But it's not coming back.

                   The captain's tired of risking his life

                   get drunk on better wine than they

                   Wait out the winter where it's 
                   beautiful and warm.

                          SHAE 
                   I met some people in Dorne who weren't 
                   so beautiful and warm. 
      01:32:19 
                          SANSA 
                   Don't ruin the game.

                          SHAE 
                   I told you, I don't want to play. 
           Sansa points at a ship on the sea.

                          SANSA 
                   What about that one there? 
      01:32:26 
                          SHAE (OS) 
                   That one?  It's going to Volantis. 
      01:32:30 
                          SANSA 
                   Why? 
      01:32:31 
                          SHAE 
                   Because when I got on a ship in 
                   Volantis, it looked like that one.

                          SANSA 
                   That's not how the game works.  You're 
                   not supposed to just blurt out the 
                   right answer.  You've got to invent a 
                   story about where the ship is going and 
                   why. 
           Littlefinger and Ros walk along the dock.  Littlefinger 
           tells Ros to stay and wait for him.  He proceeds to Shae 
           and Sansa. 
            
      01:32:46 
                          SHAE 
                   Why should I make up a story when I 
                   know the truth? 
      01:32:50 
                          SANSA 
                   Because the truth is always either 
                   terrible or boring.

                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   Lovely day for it.

                   Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for

           Sansa and Shae look at each other.  Sansa give a nod at  
           Shae.  Shae stands up and walks away.  Sansa stands up and 
           walks towards the edge of the dock with Littlefinger. 
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   I saw your mother not long ago.  She's 
                   very eager to see you.  And your 
                   sister.

                          SANSA 
                   Arya's alive?  You said you'd take me

                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   You said King's Landing was your home.  
                   You are the property of the crown.  
                   Stealing you would be treason.  If you 
                   were to tell just one person... 
      01:33:46 
                          SANSA 
                   I won't tell anyone.

                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   How do I know?

                          SANSA 
                   Because I'm a terrible liar.  You said 
                   so yourself.  Please, Lord Baelish.  
                   Tell me what to do.  Tell me when.

                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   I'm waiting for word on an assignment 
                   that will take me far away from the 
                   capital.  When I set sail, I might be 
                   able to take you with me.  But you'll

                   You're her handmaiden?

                   Yes.  And you're his...?

                          ROS 
                   I help manage his affairs.

                   He's an important person.

                          ROS 
                   So is she.  I grew up in the shadow of 
                   her father's castle.  The day she was 
                   born, they rang the bells from sunrise 
                   till sunset.  We've both done rather

      01:40:42 
                          GUARD 3(OS) 
                   Halt.  Down. 
           Joffrey notices that they have stopped.  He opens the 
           window of the litter and talks to one of the guards. 
            
      01:40:51 
                          JOFFREY 
                   Why have we stopped? 
      01:40:53 
                          SER MERYN 
                   It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.

           Joffrey opens the back window and sees Margaery stepping 
           out from another litter. 
            
      01:41:00 
                          JOFFREY (OS) 
                   What is she doing?  Who gave her 
                   permission? 
      01:41:02 
                          MAID (OS) 
                   My lady. 
           Margaery walks along an alley. 
                          MAID (OS) 
                   We should have guards, my lady. 
      01:41:06 
                          MARGAERY 
                   Why? 
           Margaery almost bumps a man walking as she was looking back 
           at her maid. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   Pardon me. 
           Margaery steps to the side and walks past the man.  A woman 
           dumps her trash from her window and down to the ground.  
           Margaery continues walking passing the side of the alley. 
            
      01:41:20 
                          MAID 
                   Stop, my lady. 
           Margaery stops walking as she looks at the entrance of an 
           orphanage. 
                          MAID (CONT'D) 
                   You'll ruin your dress.

                   I have others. 
           Margaery enters the orphanage.  Her maid follows her 
           inside. 
            
      01:41:29 
            
                          BABY (OS) 
                          (crying) 
            
           Joffrey watches Margaery through the window of his litter. 
            
      01:41:31 
                          GUARD 4 (OS) 
                   Would you like to... 
                          GUARD 4 
                   ...speak with her, Your Grace? 
           Joffrey notices the people looking at his litter. 
            
      01:41:37 
                          JOFFREY 
                   No. 
           Joffrey closes the window. 
            
      01:41:38

           INT. KING'S LANDING - ORPHANAGE - CONTINUOUS. 
            
           Margaery is sitting on the floor with a group of children. 
                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   ...soldier.  He went to fight on the 
                   walls when the ships came into

                   And your mother? 
      01:41:49 
                          BOY 
                   She died when she had me. 
      01:41:54 
                          MARGAERY 
                   Bad men wanted to come into this city 
                   and do terrible things, but your father 
                   stopped them. 
           A maid hands Margaery a toy knight.  Margaery shows the toy 
           to the boy. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   Whenever you look at this knight, I 
                   want you to remember your father. 
           Margaery gives the toy to the boy. 
            
      01:42:13 
                          BOY 
                   He wasn't a knight.  He was just a 
                   soldier. 
      01:42:17 
                          MARGAERY 
                   And what do knights swear to do?  
                   Protect the weak and uphold the good.  
                   Your father did that.  Be proud of him. 
           Margaery looks at another boy. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   Was your father... 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...a soldier, too? 
           The other boy nods.

                   You should be proud, too. 
           The boy smiles at Margaery.  The two maids pick up the 
           basket and start giving food to the children. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   Under King Joffrey's leadership your 
                   fathers saved the city.  They saved us 
                   all. 
      01:42:44 
                          BABY 2 (OS) 
                   (crying) 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   From now on... 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...we're going to take care of you. 
           Margaery touches the boy's cheek. 
            
      01:42:52 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   All of you. 
           EXT. KING'S LANDING - STREET - DAY. 
            
           The children step out of the orphanage with Margaery. 
            
      01:42:55

                   (laughs) 
           Margaery stops and turns to the Septa. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   Come to me for whatever you need to

                   feed them, clothe them, or house them.   
            
           Margaery looks at the children and looks back at the Septa. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   Directly to me. 
           The Septa nods. 
            
      01:43:10 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   (giggles) 
           Margaery kisses the girl's cheeks.  Joffrey continues to 
           look at her through the window of his litter. 
            
      01:43:13 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   (giggles) 
           INT. RED KEEP - DINNING TABLE - NIGHT. 
            
           Margaery and Loras are in the room near the table.  Joffrey 
           enters the room.  Margaery bows to Joffrey. 
            
      01:43:23 
                          MARGAERY 
                   Your Grace. 
           Loras bows at Joffrey. 
            
      01:43:25 
                          LORAS 
                   Your Grace. 
           Joffrey gestures for Margaery and Loras to sit at the table 
           as he walks to his chair. 
            
      01:43:25 
                          JOFFREY

                   the King's time?

                          MARGAERY 
                   (laughs) 
           Margaery and Loras look at each other.  Loras then looks at 
           Cersei who is standing across the table.  Joffrey sits on 
           the chair.  Joffrey notices Margaery's gown. 
            
      01:43:41 
                          JOFFREY 
                   That's a lovely gown, my lady. 
      01:43:42 
                          CERSEI (OS) 
                   Yes, it suits... 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   ...you perfectly. 
           Cersei walks towards her chair. 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   I imagine you might be rather cold. 
      01:43:47 
                          MARGAERY (OS) 
                   The climate is a bit... 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   ...more forgiving back in Highgarden,

                   Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my 
                   lady? 
           Margaery moves closer to Joffrey.

                   I am touched by your concern, Your 
                   Grace.  Luckily for us Tyrells, our 
                   blood runs quite warm.  Doesn't it, 
                   Loras?

                          LORAS 
                   Yes.

                   Loras, isn't the... 
           Margaery gestures at Cersei. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   ...queen's gown magnificent? 
           Cersei sits on her chair. 
                          MARGAERY (OS) 
                   The fabric, the embroidery, the... 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   ...metalwork.  I've never seen anything

                          CERSEI (OS) 
                   You might find a bit of armor... 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   ...quite useful once you become queen. 
           Loras takes a seat. 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   Perhaps before. 
           Margaery sits beside Loras.

                   Joffrey tells me you stopped your 
                   carriage at Flea Bottom on your way 
                   back from the step... 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   ...this morning.

                   Yes.

                   Margaery does a great deal of work with

           Cersei takes a drink from her cup.

                   You're right, of course.  But you are

           Joffrey nods. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily

                   Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery 
                   has done this sort of...charitable work 
                   before.  I'm sure she knows what she's

           Kraznys gestures the soldier to step forward.  The soldier 
           steps forward.  Kraznys moves his shield and spear away, 
           takes his dagger from its belt, and cuts a part of his 
           armor off.
