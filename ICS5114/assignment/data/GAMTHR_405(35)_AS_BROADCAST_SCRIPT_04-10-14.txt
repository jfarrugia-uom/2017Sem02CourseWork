             Tommen looks at Margaery and smiles. They nod at each other 
             and smile. Cersei steps into their eye line and stares down 
             Margaery. Margaery looks away. 
                        
        01:03:34:21 
         
             Cersei walks through the crowd toward Margaery.

        01:03:52:08 
         
             Cersei stands next to Margaery and they overlook the crowd 
             and Tommen on the throne. 
                        
                    MARGAERY 
                     Your Grace. 
         
        01:03:57:02 
                     CERSEI 
                     There he is. 
                        
        01:03:59:13 
                  MARGAERY (CONT’D)

        01:04:01:22 
                     CERSEI 
                   Long may he reign. 
         
        01:04:07:08 
                    MARGAERY 
               He sits the throne like he was born to it. 
         
        01:04:09:26 
                     CERSEI 
                 Yes. He wasn’t, though, was he?

                    MARGAERY 
                    No he wasn’t. 
        01:04:21:20 
         
             Cersei touches a mourning garment on Margaery’s arm. 
              
                     CERSEI 
                  You still mourn for Joffrey? 
         
        01:04:24:01 
                    MARGAERY 
                 He was my husband. My king. 
                        
        01:04:26:10 
                     CERSEI 
                He would have been your nightmare. 
         
        01:04:31:27 
                    MARGAERY 
                   Your Grace, I feel-- 
                        
        01:04:34:19 
                     CERSEI 
                 You knew exactly what he was. 
                        
        01:04:36:25 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                     I did, too. 
         
        01:04:39:16 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                You never love anything in the world 
         
        01:04:41:00 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                the way you love your first child. 
                        
        01:04:45:07 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                 Doesn’t matter what they do. 
         
        01:04:50:06 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                 And what he did, it shocked me. 
         
        01:04:55:04 
                       5 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                Do you think I’m easily shocked? 
        01:04:57:17 
                    MARGAERY 
                       No. 
         
        01:04:58:27 
                     CERSEI 
                 The things he did shocked me. 
         
         
         
        01:05:08:27 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                    He’s only a boy. 
         
        01:05:10:26 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                  A good boy. A decent boy.  
                        
        01:05:13:10 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                   He always has been. 
         
        01:05:15:09 
                  CERSEI (CONT’D - OS) 
               Who was the last decent king, I wonder? 
                        
        01:05:18:15 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                 He could be the first man  
                 who sits on that throne 
                        
        01:05:20:11 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                 in 50 years to actually deserve it. 
         
        01:05:24:18 
                    MARGAERY 
               It would be some consolation, wouldn’t it? 
                        
        01:05:27:10 
                  MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                For all the horror that put him there.  
                        
        01:05:35:00 
                       6 
                     CERSEI 
                   He will need help… 
        01:05:39:02 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                  if he’s going to rule well. 
                        
              Cersei and Margaery turn to face each other. 
                        
        01:05:40:26 
                    MARGAERY 
                     He has you. 
                        
        01:05:42:27 
                     CERSEI 
                  A mother is not enough. 
         
        01:05:46:25 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                 You’re still interested in being queen,  
                 I take it? 
                        
        01:05:50:04 
                    MARGAERY 
                       Oh. 
                        
        01:05:52:01 
                  MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                  After all that’s happened-- 
                        
        01:05:56:22 
                  MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                It sounds strange, I know, but I am-- 
                        
        01:06:00:09 
                  MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
               I haven’t even given any thought to it, 
                        
        01:06:02:19 
                  MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                    what comes next. 
                        
        01:06:04:16 
                  MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                It would be a great honor, of course. 
                        
        01:06:07:16 
                       7 
                 MARGAERY (CONT’D - OS) 
              But I will have to speak to my father about it. 
        01:06:12:16 
                        
                    CERSEI (OS) 
                  Yes, speak to your father. 
                        
        01:06:15:06 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                    I’ll speak to mine. 
         
        01:06:22:21 
              
             Margaery and Cersei return to looking at Tommen on the 
             throne. 
              
                    MARGAERY 
                 We may be faced with an alarming number  
                 of weddings soon.

             (chuckles) 
         
        01:06:28:02 
                 MARGAERY (CONT’D - OS) 
                I won’t even know what to call you. 
                        
        01:06:31:08 
                  MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                      Sister 
                        
        01:06:34:16 
                  MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                     or mother? 
                        
        01:06:36:24 
                  MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                      Hmm. 
                        
        01:06:40:05 
         
        INT. CASTLE HALL – DAY 
         
             Daenerys stands and looks upon her counsel sitting around a 
             table. 
                       8 
                    JORAH (OS) 
                 King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. 
                        
        01:06:44:25 
                      JORAH 
                 Murdered at his own wedding. 
                        
        01:06:46:15 
                   BARRISTAN (OS) 
                 And we have taken the Meereenese navy,  
                 Your Grace. 
                        
        01:06:49:25 
                     DAARIO 
              The Second Sons took the Meereenese navy. 
                        
        01:06:51:28 
                     DAENERYS 
                 Who told you to take the navy? 
         
        01:06:54:00 
                     DAARIO 
                      No one. 
                        
        01:06:56:05 
                     DAENERYS 
                   So why did you do it? 
                        
        01:06:58:22 
                     DAARIO 
                  I heard you liked ships. 
                        
        01:07:04:21 
                     DAENERYS 
                    How many ships? 
         
        01:07:06:13 
                    BARRISTAN 
                    93, Your Grace. 
                        
        01:07:07:24 
                     DAENERYS 
                 How many men can they carry? 
         
        01:07:09:05 
                   BARRISTAN (OS) 
                       9 
                  9,300 not counting sailors. 
                        
                        
        01:07:12:01 
                     DAENERYS 
                 Would that be enough to take  
                 to King’s Landing? 
                        
        01:07:13:27 
                      JORAH 
                  The Lannisters have more. 
                        
        01:07:16:02 
                   BARRISTAN (OS) 
              They’ve been fighting Joffrey’s wars for years. 
                        
        01:07:18:10 
                  BARRISTAN (CONT’D) 
                  They’re tired, dispersed. 
                        
        01:07:20:08 
                 BARRISTAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                  And now their king is dead. 
                        
        01:07:22:13 
                  BARRISTAN (CONT’D) 
                8,000 Unsullied, 2,000 Second Sons 
                        
        01:07:26:06 
                 BARRISTAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                 Sailing into Blackwater Bay 
                        
        01:07:28:20 
                  BARRISTAN (CONT’D) 
               and storming the gates without warning. 
         
             Daenerys raises her eyebrows at Jorah. 
         
        01:07:34:12 
                      JORAH 
                It’s hard to say. It could be enough. 
                        
        01:07:37:05 
                  JORAH (CONT’D - OS) 
                 But we’re not fighting to make you  
                 queen of King’s Landing. 
                       10 
        01:07:40:16 
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                10,000 men can’t conquer Westeros. 
                        
        01:07:43:19 
                   BARRISTAN (OS) 
               The old houses will flock to our queen. 
                        
        01:07:45:11 
                 BARRISTAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                when she crosses the Narrow Sea. 
                        
        01:07:47:01 
                      JORAH  
                The old houses will flock to whichever side  
                they think will win, 
                        
        01:07:49:22 
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                   as they always have. 
                        
             Jorah stands up from the table. 
                        
        01:07:53:29 
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                   There’s other news. 
                        
        01:07:56:04 
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                    From Yunkai. 
                        
        01:07:58:01 
                  JORAH (CONT’D - OS) 
              Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, 
                        
             Grey Worm and Missandei are standing nearby listening in. 
                        
        01:08:01:11 
                  JORAH (CONT’D - OS) 
                the Wise Masters have retaken  
                control of the city. 
                        
        01:08:04:14 
                  JORAH (CONT’D - OS) 
                They’ve reenslaved the freedmen  
                who stayed behind 
                       11 
        01:08:07:10 
                  JORAH (CONT’D - OS) 
               and sworn to take revenge against you. 
                        
            Daenerys turns away from Jorah and looks out of an open door. 
                        
        01:08:11:01 
                  JORAH (CONT’D - OS) 
                    And in Astaphor, 
                        
        01:08:13:01 
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
              the council you installed to rule over the city 
                        
        01:08:15:23 
         
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
              has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon 
                        
        01:08:18:28 
                  JORAH (CONT’D - OS) 
              who's declared himself "His Imperial Majesty." 
                        
        01:08:24:03 
                   DAENERYS (OS) 
                    Please leave me. 
                        
             All rise to leave. 
                        
        01:08:31:09 
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                    Not you Jorah. 
                        
        01:08:45:19 
                           
            Daenerys turns to speak to Jorah. Jorah moves toward Daenerys. 
                        
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
               It appears my liberation of Slavery’s Bay 
                        
        01:08:48:15 
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                  isn't going quite as planned. 
                        
                        
                        
                       12 
        01:08:51:26 
                      JORAH 
                  You could sail for Westeros 
                        
        01:08:54:12 
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                   and leave it all behind. 
                        
        01:08:56:10 
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                 A boy sits on the Iron Throne. 
         
        01:08:58:08 
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                A boy many believe to be a bastard  
                with no right to it. 
                        
        01:09:01:15 
                  JORAH (CONT’D - OS) 
                They’ve never been more vulnerable. 
                        
        01:09:04:11 
                     DAENERYS   
                You counseled me against rashness 
                once in Qarth. 
                        
        01:09:07:22 
                 DAENERYS (CONT’D - OS) 
                    I didn’t listen. 
                        
        01:09:10:11 
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                  That all worked out well. 
                        
        01:09:12:16 
         
             (chuckles) 
              
        01:09:19:13 
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                 How can I rule seven kingdoms 
                           
        01:09:22:07 
                 DAENERYS (CONT’D - OS) 
                 if I can’t control Slaver’s Bay? 
         
                       13 
        01:09:26:02 
                 DAENERYS (CONT’D - OS) 
                 Why should anyone trust me? 
                        
        01:09:28:28 
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                 Why should anyone follow me? 
         
        01:09:31:18 
                    JORAH (OS) 
                   You’re a Targaryen 
                        
        01:09:33:03 
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                 You’re the Mother of Dragons. 
                        
        01:09:37:01 
         
            Daenerys turns away from Jorah. 
             
                     DAENERYS 
                  I need to be more than that. 
                        
        01:09:45:28 
         
            Daenerys turns back toward Jorah. 
             
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                I will not let those I have freed  
                slide back into chains. 
                        
        01:09:51:24 
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                  I will not sail for Westeros. 
                        
        01:09:53:22 
                    JORAH (OS) 
                     What, then? 
                        
        01:09:57:03 
                   DAENERYS (OS) 
                  I will do what queens do. 
                        
        01:10:02:20 
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                     I will rule. 
                       14 
                        
            Daenerys walks out onto the balcony and overlooks the kingdom. 
         
                        
        01:10:40:08 
         
        EXT. THE EYRIE – DAY. 
                        
             Littlefinger and Sansa walk through the mountains toward the 
             castle. 
                        
                    LITTLEFINGER 
                   Pull up your hood. 
                        
        01:10:44:14 
                        
             Littlefinger touches Sansa’s cloak. 
                        
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   A memorable shade.

                      SANSA 
                  But how would they know?

                    LITTLEFINGER 
                You know what kind of stories  
                poor men enjoy the most? 
                        
        01:10:53:0 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
               Ones about rich girls they’ll never meet. 
                        
            Sansa pulls up her hood. 
                        
        01:11:00:16 
                    SANSA (OS) 
                Is this the only way into the Eyrie? 
         
        01:11:02:26 
                   LITTLEFINGER (OS) 
                 The mountains are impassable.

        01:11:06:18 
                LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D - OS) 
               you need to go through the Bloody Gate. 
                        
        01:11:08:17 
                LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D - OS) 
               It doesn’t matter how large your army is, 
                        
        01:11:12:04 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
              if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, 
                        
        01:11:14:23 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    three men abreast

                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                 and get slaughtered like goats. 
                        
        01:11:19:16 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                The first Lords of the Vale,  
                didn’t have much, 
                        
        01:11:22:14 
                LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D - OS) 
                 but they had these mountains 
                        
        01:11:24:02 
                LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D - OS) 
                 and they knew how to use them. 
                        
        01:11:26:03 
                LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D - OS) 
                And the fortress they built here  
                has never been overcome. 
                        
        01:11:28:22 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                  Not once in 1,000 years.

        EXT. THE EYRIE – DAY. 
              
             Robin is sitting on Lysa’s lap. He gets up and runs to 
             Littlefinger when Littlefinger enters. 
              
                      ROBIN 
                     Uncle Petyr! 
                        
             Lysa smiles. 
              
        01:12:34:00 
                   LITTLEFINGER (OS) 
                     My Lord. 
              
             Robin and Littlefinger embrace. 
         
        01:12:41:21 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                       Oh. 
                        
        01:12:43:28 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                  I have brought you a gift. 
                        
             Littlefinger hands Robin a metal bird. 
         
        01:12:52:15 
         
             Lysa looks down upon Robin and Littlefinger.

                     My lady. 
                        
                      ROBIN 
                Look what Uncle Petyr brought me. 
                        
        01:12:56:29 
                      LYSA 
                A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.

             Sansa curtsys to Lysa. 
                        
                      SANSA 
                 It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance,  
                 Lady Arryn. 
                        
        01:13:02:13 
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                    My name is Al-- 
                        
        01:13:04:03 
              
             Lysa descends the stairs toward Sansa 
         
                      LYSA 
                Oh, do put down that hood, child. 
                        
        01:13:06:16 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                Don’t you think know who you are? 
                        
        01:13:08:21 
                  LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                 You think I’d let my intended 
                        
        01:13:11:12 
                  LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                leave the Eyrie on urgent business 
                        
        01:13:13:15 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
               without knowing what that business was? 
                        
        01:13:17:19 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 I let him go so he could bring you  
                 here to me. 
         
             Lysa removes Sansa’s hood and embraces her. 
         
        01:13:25:01 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                   My flesh and blood. 
                        
                       19 
        01:13:29:11 
                      SANSA  
               It’s wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa. 
         
        01:13:31:14 
                      LYSA 
                 You mustn’t call me that in front of  
                 anyone else. 
                        
        01:13:33:22 
                      SANSA 
                  Of course. I understand.  
                        
        01:13:35:00 
                      LYSA 
                 No one can know you’re here. 
                        
        01:13:36:17 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
              It would put us in a very precarious position. 
                        
        01:13:38:23 
                      SANSA 
                  I would never say a thing. 
                        
        01:13:40:10 
                     LYSA (OS) 
                The Lannisters want to destroy us. 
         
        01:13:42:23 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 They’ve been trying for years. 
                        
        01:13:44:28 
                  LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                Now they know what it feels like. 
                        
        01:13:47:01 
                      ROBIN 
                 Mummy said they killed your mother and  
                 they chopped off your brother’s head. 
                        
        01:13:52:13 
                      SANSA 
                  They did, and my father’s. 
                        
                       20 
        01:13:55:26 
                      ROBIN 
               They killed my father, too, with poison. 
                        
        01:13:59:24 
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                 I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man  
                 fly, 
                        
        01:14:02:24 
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                  but Mother said I couldn’t. 
                        
        01:14:05:01 
                      SANSA 
                    Make him fly? 
                        
        01:14:06:26 
                      ROBIN 
                  Through the Moon Door. 
                        
             Robin drops his metal bird through the Moon Door.

                      LYSA 
                 And on top of everything else,  
                        
        01:14:15:23 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                they made you marry that filthy troll. 
                        
        01:14:18:05 
                      SANSA 
                 They did. They made us both. 
                        
        01:14:20:13 
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                  Lord Tyrion didn’t want to. 
                        
        01:14:22:01 
                     LYSA (OS 
                I don’t believe that for a moment. 
                       21 
        01:14:23:26 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 Did he force himself on you? 
         
        01:14:25:28 
                      SANSA 
                       No. 
                        
        01:14:27:23 
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                     We never--  
                        
                     LYSA (OS) 
                      Good. 
                        
        01:14:29:09 
              
             Lysa turns to Robin. 
              
                     LYSA (OS) 
                 Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. 
                        
        01:14:32:19 
                  LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                But you’re not to call her Sansa  
                in front of anyone 
         
        01:14:34:20

                but Uncle Petyr and myself. 
                Do you understand? 
         
        01:14:36:23 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 Sansa, this is my son Robin. 
                        
        01:14:40:12 
                      SANSA 
                It’s a pleasure to meet you, Robin. 
                        
        01:14:42:09 
                      LYSA 
                Robin, show Sansa to her chamber.

        01:14:49:06 
                   LITTLEFINGER (OS) 
                   Go. We’ll speak soon. 
                        
             Robin and Sansa exit. 
              
             Lysa and Littlefinger embrace and kiss. 
              
        01:15:00:24 
                      LYSA 
                  What took you so long? 
        01:15:02:27 
                    LITTLEFINGER 
                Arranging for the ascension of  
                King Tommen I, 
                        
        01:15:05:25 
                    LITTLEFINGER 
               extricating Sansa, getting her here alive. 
                        
        01:15:09:11 
                      LYSA 
                She’s here. We’ve spent more than enough  
                time on her for one evening. 
                        
        01:15:15:13 
              
             Lysa kisses Littlefinger again

        01:15:19:28 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                inform the Lords of the Vale

                     LYSA (OS) 
                There’s only one Lord of the Vale. 
                        
        01:15:24:25 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                  The others can all hang. 
                        
        01:15:26:22 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                Lurking and simpering on the stairs  
                like buzzards 
                        
        01:15:29:09 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                the moment my husband died,  
                trying to get their claws in me. 
                        
        01:15:32:19 
                    LITTLEFINGER 
                I do think that we could wait until-- 
                        
        01:15:34:05 
                      LYSA 
                  I’m done waiting, Petyr 
        01:15:36:12 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
              We had our wedding night many years ago. 
                        
        01:15:38:28 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                  Or don’t you remember? 
                        
        01:15:41:01 
                    LITTLEFINGER 
                   Like it was yesterday. 
                        
        01:15:43:26 
                     LYSA (OS) 
                 What wife would do for you  
                 the things I’ve done for you? 
                        
        01:15:48:07 
                  LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                 What wife would trust you  
                 the way I’ve trusted you? 
                       24 
        01:15:51:06 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 When you gave me those drops 
                        
        01:15:53:27 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
               and told me to pour them into Jon’s wine, 
                        
        01:15:56:13 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                   my husband's wine-- 
                        
        01:15:58:01 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
               when you told me to write a letter to Cat 
                        
        01:16:01:09 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                telling her it was the Lannisters-- 
                        
        01:16:04:15 
             
            Littlefinger interrupts Lysa with a kiss.

        01:16:15:26 
                    LITTLEFINGER 
                    The deed is done. 
                        
        01:16:17:23 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   Faded into nothing. 
                        
        01:16:20:17 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                Only speaking of it can make it real. 
                        
             Lysa nods. 
              
        01:16:26:25 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    Tonight it is, then. 
                        
        01:16:28:15 
             (laughs) 
                       25 
             Lysa rushes out of the room excitedly. 
              
        01:16:32:22 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
               Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. 
                        
        01:16:35:03 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                 Once I’m presentable,  
                 I’ll call on the septon immediately. 
                        
        01:16:45:07 
         
             Lysa brings the guard back into the room with her and returns 
             to embrace Littlefinger. 
         
                      LYSA 
                    I’m warning you. 
                        
        01:16:47:15 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 I’m going to scream when my husband  
                 makes love to me. 
                        
        01:16:51:14 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 I’m going to scream so loud, 
                        
        01:16:54:21 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
              they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea. 
                        
             Lysa kisses Littlefinger.

                you know? 
         
        01:22:41:10 
                      SANSA 
                      Really? 
                        
                       36 
                      LYSA 
                      Oh, yes. 
        01:22:42:29 
                  LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                At suppertime, she would go  
                straight for honey cakes, 
                        
        01:22:46:04 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                  candied almonds, custard. 
                        
        01:22:47:26 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                    Anything sweet. 
                        
        01:22:49:18 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 Eventually, your grandfather 
                        
        01:22:51:06 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
              had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. 
                        
        01:22:53:24 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
               Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. 
                        
             Lysa is pouring a drink while Sansa eats. 
              
        01:22:56:10 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
               It was important that she remain desirable. 
                        
        01:22:58:05 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
              so Father could arrange a good match for her 
                        
        01:23:00:02 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 and she was starting to get fat. 
                        
             Lysa sits down with Sansa. 
              
        01:23:02:23 
                      SANSA 
                    My mother fat? 
                       37 
        01:23:08:06 
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                She never let me have my pudding 
                        
        01:23:10:13 
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                until I’d finished all my proper food. 
                        
        01:23:12:08 
                     LYSA (OS) 
                This is before she married your father  
                and moved to the North. 
                        
        01:23:15:20 
                  LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                By the time you were born,  
                your father austerity had become hers. 
                        
        01:23:19:07 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                  Marriage changes people. 
                        
             Sansa puts down her food. 
              
        01:23:24:29 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 I didn’t mean for you to stop. 
                        
        01:23:27:00 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                   Go on, enjoy them. 
                        
                  Sansa continues eating. 
                        
        01:23:32:26 
         
             Lysa reaches out and holds Sansa’s hands. 
         
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                  How do you like them? 
                        
        01:23:34:29 
                      SANSA 
                    They’re delicious. 
                        
                        
                       38 
        01:23:39:20 
                      SANSA 
                Where did you get the lemons?  
                You can’t grow them up here. 
                        
        01:23:42:14 
                      LYSA 
                     Oh, gods, no. 
                        
        01:23:44:05 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                Petyr had three crates brought all the way  
                from King’s Landing. 
                        
        01:23:47:08 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 He knew you liked lemon cakes. 
                        
        01:23:49:07 
                      SANSA 
                     He’s so kind. 
         
        01:23:51:03 
                      LYSA 
                  He really cares for you. 
                        
        01:23:53:04 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                Think where you’d be without him. 
                        
        01:23:55:27 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                In their clutches and tried for murder. 
                        
        01:23:59:16 
                      SANSA 
                   Yes. I’m very lucky. 
                        
        01:24:02:17 
                      LYSA 
                 He feels responsible for you. 
                        
        01:24:04:05 
                      SANSA 
                Oh, I know he does. I’m so grateful. 
                        
                       39 
        01:24:05:22 
                     LYSA (OS) 
                      Why? 
                        
        01:24:07:21 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
               Why does he feel responsible for you? 
                        
        01:24:11:14 
                      SANSA 
                   Well, I’m half Tully. 
                        
        01:24:13:15 
                      SANSA 
                 He loved your family so much. 
                        
                      LYSA 
                   Loved your mother. 
                        
        01:24:16:03 
                     SANSA. 
                       No. 
                        
                      LYSA 
                 That’s what you wanted to say. 
                        
        01:24:17:23 
                      SANSA 
                He loves you, Aunt Lysa.  
                He’s married to you. 
                        
        01:24:19:12 
                      LYSA 
                Your mother never loved him. Never. 
                        
        01:24:21:18 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                Cat always went straight  
                for the sweetest thing. 
                        
        01:24:24:17 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                The most obvious thing.  
                Your Uncle Brandon. 
                        
                        
                       40 
        01:24:27:19 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                Your handsome, arrogant,  
                cruel Uncle Brandon. 
                        
        01:24:30:19 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 He almost killed Petyr in a duel. 
                        
        01:24:33:06 
                  LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                And your mother loved him anyway. 
                        
        01:24:35:13 
                  LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                And now Petyr is risking his life  
                to save you, 
                        
        01:24:39:03 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                the daughter of a woman  
                who didn’t love him 
                        
        01:24:41:25 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
               no more than those whores in his brothels. 
                        
        01:24:44:29 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 Has he told you about them? 
                        
                      SANSA 
                       No. 
                        
        01:24:47:25 
                     LYSA (OS) 
                He hasn’t told you about the vile things  
                they do with their bodies? 
                        
             Lysa is gripping Sansa’s hands and she is trying to pull away. 
                        
        01:24:53:01 
                  LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                He hasn’t told you about the vile things  
                they do with their bodies? 
                        
                       41 
        01:24:50:19 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
                The vile things they let him do  
                with their bodies? 
                        
        01:24:53:01 
                      SANSA 
                     No, never. 
                        
                      LYSA 
                   Are you pregnant? 
                        
        01:24:56:13 
                      SANSA 
                What? No, I told you.  
                Lord Tyrion and I never-- 
                        
        01:24:59:17 
                     LYSA (OS) 
                 I wasn’t asking about Tyrion. 
                        
        01:25:01:16 
                    LYSA (CONT’D) 
              What have you let Petyr do with your body? 
                        
        01:25:03:14 
                      SANSA 
                    Aunt Lysa, no, I-- 
                        
                      LYSA 
                  Your young, pretty body. 
                        
        01:25:06:06 
                    SANSA (OS) 
                   Nothing. I’m a virgin. 
                        
                     LYSA (OS) 
                    Don’t lie to me. 
                        
             Lysa is tightening her grip on Sansa’s hands. 
                        
        01:25:08:25 
                        
                      SANSA 
                   You’re hurting me. 
                        
                       42 
        01:25:12:05 
                      LYSA 
                   I’ll know if you lie. 
                        
        01:25:13:23 
                      SANSA 
                   I’m a virgin, I swear it. 
         
        01:25:16:13 
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                  He loves you, Aunt Lysa. 
                        
        01:25:18:08 
                        
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                 All he says is that I’m stupid. 
                        
        01:25:20:11 
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
               I’m a stupid little girl with stupid dreams 
                        
        01:25:22:11 
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
               who never learns and I’m a terrible liar, 
                        
        01:25:24:10 
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                 so I should always tell the truth. 
                        
        01:25:25:18 
                  SANSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                And I swear to you that

        01:26:14:22 
                     PODRICK (CONT’D) 
                   There wasn’t much call for it  
                   with Lord Tyrion, though. 
                           
        01:26:16:20 
                     PODRICK (CONT’D) 
                      He preferred litters. 
                           
        01:26:19:11 
                        BRIENNE 
                 Perhaps you should have stayed with him.

                 It could take week to get to the Wall,  
                 depending on the weather. 
                           
        01:26:33:24 
                      PODRICK (OS)

                I’ve made it this far in the world without a squire.

                     BRIENNE (CONT’D) 
                   I don’t see why I need one now.

                    BRIENNE (CONT’D - OS) 
                And I’m not a slaver, either. I don’t own you.

                      PODRICK (OS) 
                     I swore an oath, my lady. 
                           
        01:26:59:04 
                       BRIENNE (OS) 
                   I’m releasing you from that oath.

                     BRIENNE (CONT’D) 
                    That means you could leave. 
                           
        01:27:06:27

                        I know. 
                           
        01:27:08:24 
                      BRIENNE (OS) 
                 What do you think will happen if you leave? 
                           
        01:27:12:15 
                      PODRICK (OS) 
                 They’ll all say I wasn’t a very good squire.

                        OBERYN 
                      A poem, actually.

                     OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                   I named her after my sister Elia.

                  But I can’t say it without turning sad.

                     OBERYN (CONT’D)

                     OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                       I grow angry.

                 I brought him his meals and cleared his table

                        JOJEN 
                  If he sees you, he won’t let you go north. 
                           
        01:45:47:18 
                         BRAN

        01:45:55:01 
                     JOJEN (CONT’D - OS) 
                      You have to decide.
