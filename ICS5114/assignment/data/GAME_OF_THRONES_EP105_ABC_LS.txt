                           NED
                   Does Ser Hugh have any family in the
                   capitol?
                           BARRISTAN
                   No.
           PULL BACK TO REVEAL BARRISTAN, NED, SISTER AND SER HUGH.
                           BARRISTAN
                   I stood vigil for him myself last night.
                   He had no one else.
                           NED
                   He'd never worn this armor before.
                           BARRISTAN
                   Bad luck for him, going against the
                   Mountain.
                           NED
                   Who determines the draw?

                                    BARRISTAN
                        Life is strange. Not so many years ago
                        we fought as enemies at the Trident.
                                    NED
                        I'm glad we never met in the field, Ser
                        Barristan. As is my wife. I don't think
                        the widow's life would suit her.
                                    BARRISTAN
                        You're too modest. I've seen you cut
                        down a dozen great knights.
                                    NED
                        My father once told me you were the best
                        he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to
                        be wrong about matters of combat.
                                    BARRISTAN
                        He was a fine man, your father. What the
                        Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.
                                    NED
                        That lad… he was a squire a few months
                        ago. How could he afford a new suit of
                        armor?
                                    BARRISTAN
                        Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money?
                        I hear the King wants to joust today.
                                    NED
                        Nah. That's never gonna happen.

                         If the king got what he wanted all the
                         time, he'd still be fighting a damned
                         rebellion.

               NED STEPS INTO PAVILION.
                                    LANCEL
                         It's made too small, your grace.It
                         won't go.
                                    ROBERT
                         Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat
                         ass. Did you know that? Look at this
                         idiot. One ball and no brains. He can't
                         even put a man's armor on him properly.
                                    NED
                         You're too fat for your armor.
                                    ROBERT
                         Fat? Fat is it? Is that how you speak
                         to your king? [LAUGH]

                                    ROBERT
                         No? You don't like the Hand's joke?
                                    NED

                        You heard the Hand. The king's too fat
                        for his armor. Go find the breastplate
                        stretcher. Now!

                                    ROBERT
                        All right. All right. You watch me out
                        there. I still know how to point a
                        lance.

                        that for the young men.
                                    ROBERT
                        Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I
                        wanna hit somebody.

                        There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms
                        would risk hurting you.
                                    ROBERT

                         Mm. Bloody idiot, but Cersei insisted.
                         I have John Arryn to thank for her.
                         Cersei Lannister will make a good match,
                         he told me. You'll need her father on
                         your side. I thought being king meant I
                         could do whatever I wanted. Enough of
                         this. Let's go watch 'em ride. At least

                   have been so nice for you to have a

                         This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we
                         were riding for Winterfell.
                                    CATELYN
                         I did. Often and loudly.

                         Very wise. They'll be out in droves
                         looking for me in the wrong place.
                         Word's probably gotten to my father by
                         now. He'll be offering a handsome
                         reward. Everyone knows a Lannister
                         always pays his debts. Would you be so
                         good as to untie me?

                         Why not? Am I going to run? The hill
                         tribes would kill me for my boots.
                         Unless a shadowcat ate me first.

                         the Vale. You're taking me to your
                         sisters to answer for my imagined crimes.
                         Tell me, Lady Stark, when was the last
                         time you saw your sister?

                         me here.

                        Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin. A
                        very bad thing. You remember her, don’t
                        you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong,
                        too? Jon knew it. His last words were
                        "the seed is strong". He wanted everyone
                        to know what a good, strong boy his son
                        would grow up to be. Look at him. The
                        Lord of all the Vale.

                         Mommy? Is that a bad man?
                                    LYSA
                         It is.
                                    ROBIN
                         Huh. He's little.
                                    LYSA
                         He's Tyrion the Imp of the House of
                         Lannister. He killed your father. He
                         murdered the Hand of the King!
                                    TYRION
                         Oh! Did I kill him, too? I've been a
                         very busy man.

                         You will watch your tongue! These men
                         are knights of the Vale. Every one of
                         them loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them
                         would die for me.

                         If any harm comes to me, my brother,
                         Jaime, will see that they do.
                                    ROBIN
                         You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us
                         here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!

                         He's just trying to frighten us.
                         Lannisters are all liars. No one will
                         hurt my baby.

                   You're jealous.

                   You sure this won't hurt?

                   Only if I slip.

                        If you want hairless, maybe you should
                        find a little boy.
                                    LORAS
                        I want you.
                                    RENLY
                        My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't
                        been to war isn't a man. He treats me as
                        if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're
                        not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the
                        Flowers? How many wars have you fought
                        in? Oh, and ah, how much did you father
                        spend on that armor of yours?
                                    LORAS
                        Hold still.
                                    RENLY
                        All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis
                        is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm
                        at the sight of blood.
                                    LORAS
                        You did vomit in that boy's eye when he
                        was knocked out in the melee.
                                    RENLY
                        His eye was dangling out of the damn
                        socket.
                                    LORAS
                        He shouldn’t have entered the melee if he
                        didn’t know how to fight.
                                    RENLY
                        Easy for you to say.  Not everyone is
                        such a gifted swordsman.
                                    LORAS
                        Urh. It's not a gift. No one gave it to
                        me. I'm good because I worked it every
                        day of my life since I could hold a
                        stick.

                        I could work it all day, every day. I'd
                        still never be as good as you.
                                    LORAS
                        Yes, well, I guess we'll never know.
               LORAS LIFTS RENLY'S ARM TO EXPOSE HIS ARMPIT AND BEGIN TO
               SHAVE IT.
                                    RENLY
                        Everywhere?
                                    LORAS
                        Everywhere. So how did it end up? The
                        Targaryen girl will die?
                                    RENLY
                        It needs to be done. Unpleasant as it
                        is. Robert is rather tasteless about it.
                        Every time he talks about killing her, I
                        swear the table rises six inches.
                                    LORAS
                        It's a shame he can't muster the same
                        enthusiasm for his wife.
                                    RENLY
                        He does have a deep, abiding lust for her
                        money. You have to give it to the
                        Lannisters. They may be the most
                        pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever
                        suffered to walk the world, but they do
                        have an outrageous amount of money.

                   'Cause he loves his killing. And he used

                   Be serious.

                   I am. My father could be your bank.
                   I've never fought in a war before. But
                   I'd fight for you.

                        didn't work out. You seemed so good

                        He's not serious enough. I'll say this
                        for Ned Stark. He's serious enough. Was
                        it really worth it? Losing him this way?

                        I don’t know. But I do know this. The
                        Targaryen girl convinces her horselord
                        husband to invade, and the Dothraki horde
                        crosses the Narrow Sea, we won't be able
                        to stop them.

                        It's a neat little trick you do. You
                        move your lips and your father's voice
                        comes out.

                        Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with
                        forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his
                        back. We hole up in our castles. Wise
                        move. Only a fool would meet the
                        Dothraki in an open field. They leave us
                        in our castles. They go from town to
                        town looting and burning, killing every
                        man who can't hide behind a stone wall,
                        stealing all our crops and livestock,
                        enslaving all our women and children.
                        How long do the people of the Seven
                        Kingdoms stand behind their absentee
                        king? Their cowardly king, hiding behind
                        high walls. When do the people decide
                        that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful
                        monarch after all?

                   At first, just saying her name, even in

                   back into her. I thought if I didn’t
                   talk about her, she'd just fade away for
                   you. When I realized that wasn’t going

                                    JAIME
                        Come, Stark.  I'd rather you die sword in
                        hand.

                        Threaten? As in, I'm going to open your
                        lord from balls to brains and see what
                        Starks are made of.
                                    NED
                        If you kill me, your brother's a dead
                        man.
                                    JAIME
                        You're right. Take him alive. Kill his
                        men.
               FIGHTING ENSUES. JAIME STABS A MAN IN THE EYE, THEN
               MOVES TOWARD NED. NED AND JAIME FIGHT.
               NED IS STABBED IN THE BACK AND FALLS TO THE GROUND ON
               BENDED KNEE.
               AS NED WATCHES, JAIME MOUNTS HIS HORSE AND PREPARES TO
               LEAVE.
