                   shit of an imp to King’s Landing. She’s

                   Starks and the Lannisters are at each

                   Piss on that. Send the raven, I want you
                   to stay. I’m the king, I get what I
                   want.
           ROBERT TAKES DRINK
                   I never loved my brothers. A sad thing
                   for a man to admit but it’s true. You
                   were the brother I chose.

                   I’m a vile man, I confess it. My crimes
                   and sins are beyond counting. I have
                   lied and cheated and gambled and whored.
                   I’m not particularly good at violence but
                   I’m good at convincing others to do
                   violence for me. You want specifics I
                   suppose? When I was seven I saw a
                   servant girl bathing in the river. I
                   stole her robe. She was forced to return
                   to the castle naked and in tears. If I
                   close my eyes I can still see her tits
                   bouncing. When I was ten I stuffed my
                   uncle’s boots with goat shit. When
                   confronted with my crime I blamed a
                   squire.Poor boy was flogged and I
                   escaped justice.

                        because the voices in his head told him
                        they deserved it? Or way before that,

                   he promised me. He bought you but he
                   never paid for you.

                   I’m taking you back. He can keep the
                   baby. I’ll cut it out and leave it for
                   him.
