           Roose walks up the stairs towards the battlements.  He then sees 
           Robb's men are being slain by Frey's allies.

           The Hound rides his horse out of the castle with Arya leaning on 
           his chest, out cold.  The Hound stops, takes a banner of Frey 
           and rides the horse away from the castle.

           The Hound stops and turns to the direction of the chanting 
           soldiers.

                   King in the North! 
           The soldiers are marching out of the castle.  Robb's body, with 
           Grey Wind's head, is mounted on a horse. 
                          SOLDIERS (CONT'D)

           Arya wakes up, looks at The Hound and at the soldiers marching.

           Tyrion and Sansa are walking together along a path.  Shae is 
           following them.  Eldrick and Desmond pass by them.  Tyrion looks 
           at Eldrick and Desmond.

                          SANSA (to Tyrion) 
                   What are you doing? 
      01:03:40      
                          TYRION 
                   I have a list. 
      01:03:42      
                          SANSA 
                   A list of people you mean to kill? 
      01:03:43      
                          TYRION 
                   For laughing at me?  Do I look like 
                   Joffrey to you?  No, death seems a bit 
                   extreme.  Fear of death, on the other 
                   hand...

                   You should learn to ignore them. 
      01:03:52      
                          TYRION 
                   My lady, people have been laughing at 
                   me far longer than they've been 
                   laughing at you.  I'm the Halfman, the 
                   Demon Monkey, the Imp. 
      01:04:01      
                          SANSA 
                   You're a Lannister.  I am the disgraced 
                   daughter of the traitor Ned Stark. 
      01:04:06      
                          TYRION 
                   The disgraced daughter and the Demon 
                   Monkey.  We're perfect for each other.

                   (chuckles) 
           Tyrion and Shae look at each other.  Tyrion looks away. 
                          SANSA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   So how... 
                    
                          SANSA (CONT'D) 
                   ...should we punish them? 
      01:04:16      
                          TYRION 
                   Who?  Whom?

                          TYRION 
                   Ah.  I could speak to Lord Varys and 
                   learn their perversions.  Anyone named 
                   Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert. 
      01:04:30      
                          SANSA 
                   I hear that you're a pervert. 
      01:04:32      
                          TYRION 
                   I am the Imp.  I have certain standards 
                   to maintain.

                   (chuckles) 
           Sansa walks towards a bench, sits on it and leans closer to 
           Tyrion.  Tyrion stops in front of her. 
                          SANSA (CONT'D) 
                   We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's 
                   bed. 
           Tyrion is making a face and glances at Shae. 
                          SANSA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   You cut a little hole... 
                    
                          SANSA (CONT'D) 
                   ...in his mattress and you stuff sheep 
                   dung inside.  Then you sew up the hole 
                   and make his bed again.  His room will 
                   stink, but he won't know where it's 
                   coming from.

                   My sister used to do that when she was 
                   angry with me.  And she was always 
                   angry with me. 
      01:04:58      
                          TYRION 
                   Why sheep shift? 
      01:05:00      
                          SANSA 
                   That's the vulgar word... 
                    
                          SANSA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...for dung. 
           Shae smiles and Tyrion glances at her.

                   Well, you asked me. 
           Podrick runs down the stairs and rushes by two women. 
            
      01:05:07 
                          WOMEN 
                   Oh!  (giggle)

                          WOMAN 
                   That's him! 
           Podrick runs up to Tyrion and Sansa and bows.

           Tyrion walks towards the table.  Cersei, Tywin, Varys and 
           Pycelle are seated at the table.  Joffrey walks towards Tywin 
           and stands next to him. 
            
      01:05:23 
                          TYRION (to Joffrey) 
                   Killed a few puppies today? 
           Tyrion sits down in his chair.  Joffrey looks at Pycelle and 
           points to Tyrion. 
            
      01:05:26 
                          JOFFREY 
                   Show him. 
           Joffrey moves to the other side of Cersei. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   Come on, show him. 
           Pycelle hands the scroll to Tyrion.  Tyrion reaches for the 
           scroll, but Pycelle drops it purposefully. 
            
      01:05:33 
                          PYCELLE 
                   Oh, apologies, my lord.  Old fingers. 
           Tyrion stoops down and takes the scroll from the floor.  He then 
           opens the scroll and reads it.  Joffrey looks at Tyrion.  Tyrion 
           reads the scroll. 
            
      01:05:46 
                          TYRION (OS) 
                   "Roslin..." 
                    
                          TYRION (CONT'D)

           Joffrey chuckles while turning to Cersei. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf 
                   pelts for her wedding.  Signed Walder 
                   Frey." 
           Tyrion stops reading.  Joffrey nods his head while looking at 
           Tyrion. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D - to Joffrey) 
                   Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to 
                   mean something? 
      01:06:02      
                          JOFFREY (OS) 
                   Robb... 
                    
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   ...Stark is dead. 
                    
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   (laughing) And his bitch mother. 
           Joffrey turns to Pycelle. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   Write back to Lord Frey. 
                    
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Thank him for his service and command 
                   him... 
                    
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   ...to send Robb Stark's head. 
           Tyrion sets the scroll down on the table. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   I'm going to serve it to Sansa at... 
           Joffrey turns to Cersei. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D)

                   Your Grace... 
           Joffrey turns to Varys. 
                          VARYS (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...Lady Sansa... 
           Varys looks at Cersei and at Joffrey. 
                          VARYS (CONT'D) 
                   ...is your aunt by marriage. 
      01:06:23      
                          CERSEI 
                   A joke.  Joffrey did not mean it. 
           Joffrey turns to Cersei. 
            
      01:06:25 
                          JOFFREY 
                   Yes, I did.  I'm going to have it 
      01:06:30     served to Sansa at my wedding feast. 
                          TYRION (OS) 
                   No. 
           Joffrey turns to Tyrion. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   She is no longer yours to torment. 
           Joffrey moves closer to Tyrion. 
            
      01:06:35 
                          JOFFREY 
                   Everyone is mine to torment.  You'd do 
                   well to remember that, you little 
                   monster.

           Joffrey walks back to Cersei. 
            
      01:06:42 
                          TYRION 
                   Oh, I'm a monster.  Perhaps you should 
                   speak to me more softly, then. 
           Varys is smiling. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Monsters are dangerous... 
                    
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   ...and just now kings are dying like... 
                    
                          TYRION (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...flies. 
           Joffrey looks at Tyrion in shock.  He then looks at Tywin and 
           back at Tyrion. 
            
      01:07:01 
                          JOFFREY 
                   I could have your... 
           Joffrey points at Tyrion. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   ...tongue out... 
                    
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...for saying that. 
           Cersei holds Joffrey's hand and comforts him. 
            
      01:07:06 
                          CERSEI 
                   Let him make his threats.  Hmm?  He's a 
                   bitter little...

                   ...disrespectful... 
           Joffrey pulls his hands away from Cersei. 
                          PYCELLE (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...and in very bad taste. 
           Joffrey points at himself. 
            
      01:07:19 
                          JOFFREY 
                   I am the king! 
           Varys leans away from Joffrey.  Joffrey points at Tyrion. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   I will punish you.

                   Any man who must... 
           Joffrey turns to Tywin. 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   ...say, "I am the king" is no true 
                   king.  I'll make sure you understand 
                   that when I've won your war for you. 
           Joffrey points at himself. 
            
      01:07:33 
                          JOFFREY 
                   My father won the real war.  He killed

           Cersei stands up.

                          JOFFREY 
                   I'm not tired. 
           Cersei comforts Joffrey.

                   We have so much to celebrate.  A 
                   wedding to plan.  You must rest. 
           Cersei holds Joffrey's hand and leads him away from the chamber.

                   Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of 
                   nightshade to help him... 
           Joffrey stops and turns to Tywin. 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...sleep.

                   Come. 
           Joffrey and Cersei walk away.  Pycelle gets up to leave but 
           grabs the parcel on the table.  Varys follow him out.  Tyrion 
           gets up to leave.

                          TYWIN (to Tyrion) 
                   Not you. 
           Tyrion stops short and turns to Tywin.

                          TYRION

                   You're a fool if you believe he's the 
                   most powerful man in Westeros.

                          TYRION 
                   A treasonous statement.  Joffrey is 
                   king.

           Tyrion sits back down. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   I think armies give you power.

                   battle, and you defeated...

                          TYRION 
                   Oh, I know.  Walder Frey gets all the 
                   credit.  Or the blame, I suppose, 
                   depending on your allegiance. 
                    
                          TYRION (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Walder Frey is many things, but a brave 
                   man? 
                    
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   No.  He never would have risked such an 
                   action if he didn't have certain

                   Kill me. 
           Ramsay leans forward and puts his hand behind his ear.

                          RAMSAY 
                   A little louder.

                          THEON 
                   (sobbing) Kill me! 
      01:18:58      
                          RAMSAY 
                   You're no good to me dead. 
           Ramsay takes the knife from the plate. 
                          RAMSAY (CONT'D) 
                   We need you. 
           Ramsay points the knife at Theon.  He then wipes his mouth with 
           a napkin, stands up and walks towards Theon. 
            
      [MUSIC IN] 
            
           Theon squirms.  Ramsay grabs Theon by the hair.  He then puts 
           his hand on Theon's chest. 
                          RAMSAY (CONT'D) 
                   You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy 
                   anymore.  That's a name for a lord.  
                   But you're not a lord, are you?  You're 
                   just meat.

                   Stinking meat.  (sniffs) You reek.       
            
           Ramsay steps back. 
                          RAMSAY (CONT'D) 
                   (gasps) Reek!  That's a good name for 
                   you.  What's your name? 
           Theon glares at Ramsay.

                          THEON 
                   Theon Greyjoy. 
           Ramsay backhands Theon in the face. 
                          THEON (CONT'D) 
                   (grunts) 
      01:20:06      
                          RAMSAY 
                   What's your name? 
      01:20:09      
                          THEON 
                   Th--Theon Greyjoy. 
           Ramsay hits him again. 
                          THEON (CONT'D) 
                   (gurgles) Please. 
           Ramsay holds Theon's head. 
            
      01:20:23 
                          RAMSAY 
                   What is your name?!

                   Tyrion Lannister is one of the few 
                   people alive who could make this 
                   country a better place.  He has the 
                   mind for it, he has the will, he has 
                   the right last name.  And you--you are 
                   a complication.  I know you love him.

                   And I know it's true love not bought by 
                   gold and silver.  I'm not asking you to 
                   leave him for money.  I'm asking you to 
                   leave because your presence in the 
                   capital endangers him.  This will never 
                   be your home, my lady.  Find a true 
                   home somewhere far from here...while 
                   there's still time.

           INT. RED KEEP - TYRION'S CHAMBER - NIGHT. 
            
           Tyrion and Podrick are sitting at a table drinking wine.  A 
           servant girl stands up and walks away.  Tyrion picks up the 
           carafe.

           Podrick shakes his head and puts his glass on the table.

                          PODRICK 
                   I don't think I can, my lord. 
           Tyrion pours more wine in Podrick's cup.

                          TYRION 
                   It's not easy being drunk all the time. 
           Tyrion fills his cup. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   Everyone would do it if it were easy. 
           Podrick drinks from his cup.  Cersei walks over to Tyrion and 
           Podrick.

           Podrick puts down his cup and stands.  He then leaves the room. 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   So, enjoying married life? 
           Cersei walks towards a table.  Tyrion takes Podrick's cup and 
           pours it in his cup.  Cersei takes a flagon and pours herself a 
           glass.

                   trying to work out who deserves what... 
           Cersei walks over in front of Tyrion. 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D)

                   I won't be marrying Ser Loras.

                   ...something similar about my own 
                   marriage.

                          CERSEI 
                   You're not me. 
                    
                          CERSEI (CONT'D - OS) 
                   You want to make things better for

                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   Give her a child. 
      01:36:44      
                          TYRION 
                   So you can tell Father it was you who 
                   finally talked me into it? 
      01:36:48      
                          CERSEI 
                   So she can have some happiness in her 
                   life.

                          TYRION 
                   You have children.  How happy would you

                   Not very.  But if it weren't for my 
                   children, I'd have thrown myself from 
                   the highest window in the Red Keep.  
                   They're the reason I'm alive.

                   He was all I had once.  Before Myrcella

                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   I used to spend hours looking at him.  
                   His wisps of hair.  His tiny little 
                   hands and feet.  He was such a jolly 
                   little... 
                    
                          CERSEI (CONT'D - OS)

                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   ...terrible ones were terrible babies.  
                   "We should have known.  Even then we 
                   should have known."  It's nonsense.  
                   Whenever he was with me, he was happy. 
           Cersei sits down with Tyrion. 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   And no one can take that away from me, 
                   not even Joffrey--how it feels to have 
                   someone.  Someone of your own. 
           Cersei drinks from her glass.  She then sets the glass on the 
           table.

                   What do you want?

           The Frey soldier tries to takes the coin from Arya, but Arya 
           drops the coin purposefully on the ground.

                   Little shit.

           soldier by the neck and stabs him again and again.

           Davos is setting scrolls down on a table.  Davos takes a scroll   
           and tries to read it.

                   ...going to go to that. 
           Davos puts the paper on the table.  Shireen shows Davos her 
           book.

                          SHIREEN 
                   My books are better than these boring 
                   scrolls.  You could read about Balerion 
                   the Dread.  They say you can still see 
                   his skull in the dungeons beneath the

           Shireen stands up and walks to a corner. 
                          DAVOS (CONT'D)

                   But now that I'm your father's Hand... 
           Davos takes the scroll from the Night's Watch.

                   The king does not have time for this

                   I've seen things crawl out of 
                   nightmares, but my eyes were open.  I 
                   don't know if Robb Stark died because 
                   of the Red Woman's sorcery or because 
                   at war men die all the time, but I do 
                   know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms 
                   with blood magic is wrong. 
           Stannis stands up. 
                          DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                   It is evil.  And you are not an evil 
                   man. 
           Stannis walks along the table.

                   Don't stop.  There's bread and water.

           Davos puts the bag in the boat.  Davos pushes the boat into the 
           water.

                   If you finish it off, no matter how

                   They were looking for me for 20 years.  
                   Do they know your face?

                   I'd worry more about the Red Woman. 
           Gendry gets on the boat.  He then sits down on the beam and 
           faces the bow.

           and pulls out the scroll from his belt.
