             Stannis paces back and forth in front of Davos. 
                           
                        DAVOS 
              Your Grace, if you’d like to sit, I’m sure that--  
         
        01:02:49:23 
                     STANNIS 
                 We’ve been here since midday. 
         
        01:03:00:28 DAVOS (OS) 
                 Easterners have a different sense of time,  
                 I’ve often found. 
         
                   DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                 Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan  
                 here in Braavos. 
                        
                   DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                 Together, we were going to run 
                        
                   DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                 three shiploads of the finest--  
                        
             Davos stops speaking.  Stannis continues pacing, faster now.

                   (doors open) 
         
             Tycho enters with two attendants. 
              
        01:03:40:17 
         
             Tycho sits at his desk. Stannis and Davos stand opposite him 
             on the other side of the desk. 
         
                      TYCHO 
                  Welcome to the Iron Bank. 
         
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
                     Please, sit. 
         
             Tycho extends his hand and welcomes Stannis to sit. Stannis 
             slowly crosses the room and sits down. 
         
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
               What can we do for you, Lord Stannis? 
         
        01:04:11:06 
         
             Davos steps forward to stand beside Stannis and introduce him. 
         
                     DAVOS 
               This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, 
         
                  DAVOS (CONT’D – OS ) 
                King of the Andals and the First Men, 
         
                   DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and  
                Protector of the Realm. 
                        
             Tycho gestures for Davos to sit. Davos sits down. 
                        
        01:04:22:12 
                    TYCHO (OS)

                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
                King of the Andals and the First Men, 
                        
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
                Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and  
                Protector of the Realm. 
                        
        01:04:31:02 
                     STANNIS 
                 He shares no blood with me. 
                        
                  STANNIS (CONT’D - OS) 
                 He is a bastard born of incest. 
                        
             Tycho smiles. 
              
                  STANNIS (CONT’D - OS) 
                 As was his brother before him. 
                        
        01:04:39:04   TYCHO 
                 Yes, we have heard this story. 
                        
        01:04:41:26 
                     STANNIS 
                 It’s not a story. It’s the truth. 
         
        01:04:44:18 
                      TYCHO 
              The king’s grandfather tells a different story. 
                        
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
                 A story about a jealous uncle 
                        
                  TYCHO (CONT’D - OS) 
                whose attempts to usurp the throne  
                from the rightful king 
                        
                        
                  TYCHO (CONT’D - OS) 
                cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly  
                in blood and gold. 
                        
        01:04:57:18 
                     STANNIS 
                   Gold you loaned him. 
                       4 
        01:04:59:13 
                    TYCHO (OS) 
                 And you feel your blood gives you  
                 a claim on our gold? 
                        
        01:05:03:18 
                     STANNIS 
                  More than any man living. 
         
        01:05:06:09 
                      TYCHO 
              Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled 
                        
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
               with words like “usuper” and “madman” 
                        
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
                    and “blood right.” 
                        
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
               Here, our books are filled with numbers. 
                        
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
                 We prefer the stories they tell. 
                        
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
                     More plain. 
                        
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
                  Less open to interpretation. 
                        
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
                How many fighting men remain loyal  
                to you? 
                        
          01:05:30:28 
                     STANNIS 
                      4,000 
           
        01:05:32:14 
                    TYCHO (OS) 
                And how many ships do you have? 
                        
             Davos begins to interject. 
              
              
                       5 
                  TYCHO (CONT’D - OS) 
                The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom  
                of Blackwater Bay. 
                        
        01:05:40:21 
                     DAVOS 
                       32. 
         
        01:05:42:11 
                    TYCHO (OS) 
               And how much wheat and barley and beef 
              
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
               and pork do you produce on Dragonstone 
                        
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
               to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships? 
         
        01:05:53:16 
                     STANNIS 
                      None. 
                        
        01:05:55:17 
                      TYCHO 
            You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up. 
                        
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
               to a happy ending from our perspective. 
                        
                        
                  TYCHO (CONT’D - OS) 
                 I’m afraid we must respectfully  
                        
                  TYCHO (CONT’D - OS) 
                   decline your request. 
                        
             Stannis and Davos look down sullenly.  
                        
                  TYCHO (CONT’D - OS) 
                But we thank you for paying us the honor  
                of your visit. 
                        
        01:06:20:12 
         
             Stannis gets up and crosses to his left. Davos stands up behind 
             him and looks on at Tycho. 
                       6 
                     DAVOS 
                     My lord. 
                        
        01:06:21:19 
                      TYCHO 
                I’m not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. 
         
        01:06:26:19 
                   TYCHO (CONT’D) 
                 You would not be either here. 
                        
                  TYCHO (CONT’D - OS) 
                In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles. 
              
        01:06:26:19 
         
             Davos faces Tycho as Stannis stands behind him looking in the 
             opposite direction at the door. 
         
                     DAVOS 
              Well, strictly speaking, I didn’t do the thieving. 
                        
                   DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                  That would be the pirates. 
                        
                   DAVOS (CONT’D) 
               I just moved what they stole from one place to another. 
        01:06:26:19 
              
             Davos removes his glove and puts his hand up and out in 
             explanation toward Tycho. Davos is missing his fingers. 
                        
                        
                   DAVOS (CONT’D) 
               This is the payment that was demanded  
                        
                  DAVOS (CONT’D - OS) 
                 by King Stannis for my crimes. 
                        
                   DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                I consider it an honest accounting. 
                        
                  DAVOS (CONT’D - OS) 
                He’s an honest man and he’s  
                your best chance. 
                        
                       7 
             Davos puts his glove back on. 
         
                   DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                to get back the money you’ve sunk  
                into Westeros. 
         
                  DAVOS (CONT’D - OS) 
                Which is a lot, I imagine.  
                Wars are expensive. 
                        
        01:06:53:14 
                      TYCHO 
                    The war is over. 
                        
        01:06:54:27 
                     DAVOS 
                As long as Stannis lives,  
                the war is not over. 
                        
         
        01:06:57:05 
                  DAVOS (CONT’D - OS) 
               Who’s the real power in King’s Landing? 
                        
        01:06:59:07 
                      TYCHO 
                     Ser Davos… 
                        
                     DAVOS 
                     Humor me. 
                        
        01:07:01:24 
                    TYCHO (OS) 
                    Tywin Lannister. 
                        
                     DAVOS 
                 How old is Tywin Lannister? 
                        
                        
        01:07:05:08 
                      TYCHO 
                       67. 
                        
                     DAVOS 
              67. And when he dies, who’s in command? 
                        
                       8 
         01:07:08:20 
                          DAVOS 
                       A half-grown boy, 
                             
                     DAVOS (CONT’D - OS) 
                      the product of incest? 
                             
                       DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                  Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people  
                  despise her? 
                             
                     DAVOS (CONT’D - OS) 
                  Jaime Lannister, a man best known  
                  for killing the king 
                             
                     DAVOS (CONT’D - OS) 
                      he was sworn to protect? 
                             
                       DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                  When Tywin’s gone, who do you back? 
          
         01:07:24:16 
                          TYCHO 
                   That is a problem for another time. 
                             
         01:07:27:05 
                          DAVOS 
                  Begging your pardon, I think it’s a problem  
                  for now. 
                             
                       DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                  There’s only one reliable leader left  
                  in Westeros. 
                             
               Davos points out to Stannis. 
                
                       DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                          Stannis. 
                             
                       DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                      He’s got the birthright. 
                             
                       DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                       He’s in his prime. 
                             
                       DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                  He’s a tried and tested battle commander. 
                           9 
                   DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                And he doesn’t just talk about  
                paying people back, 
                        
             Davos again puts his hand out to Tycho, keeping his glove on. 
                        
                   DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                     he does it. 
                        
        01:07:48:27 
             INT. BATH HOUSE – DAY 
         
             A naked woman descends into a bath toward a man. 
                        
                  SALLAHDOR SAAN (OS) 
              The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way. 
                        
               SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                The captain shouts to his first mate, 
                        
             Saan sits with two women listening to him as he tells a joke. 
                        
                SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D) 
                  “Bring me my red shirt.” 
                        
                SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D) 
                The first mate brings the red shirt  
                and the captain puts it on. 
                        
                SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D) 
                And when the pirates try to board, 
                        
        01:08:00:19 
                SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D) 
               the brave captain leads his men to victory. 
                        
               SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D - OS) 
               A few days later, the lookout screams, 
                        
                SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D) 
                   “Two pirate ships!” 
                        
                SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D) 
               The crew is shivering like scared mice. 
                        
                SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D) 
                       10 
              But the captain courageous captain hollers, 
                        
               SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                  “Bring me my red shirt!” 
                        
        01:08:16:08 
         
             Davos enters the bath house. 
                        
               SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                After the battle, the first mate asks, 
                        
               SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                “Captain, why do you call for your red shirt  
                before battle?” 
                        
               SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                   The captain replies,  
                        
               SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                “So that if I am stabbed, you will not see  
                me bleed.” 
                        
        01:08:27:21 
                SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D) 
               The next morning the lookout screams, 
                        
                SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D) 
                    “10 pirate ships!” 
                        
                SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D) 
                   “We are surrounded!” 
                        
            (women laugh) 
                        
             Davos stands behind Saan. 
              
               SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                   The crew goes silent. 
                        
        01:08:35:05 
               SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                They all look to their brave captain, 
                        
               SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                 waiting for his usual command. 
                       11 
                        
             Davos sits down behind Saan, listening. 
         
               SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                Calm as ever, the captain bellows… 
                        
        01:08:43:24 
                     WOMEN 
                 “Bring me my brown pants!” 
                        
              (laughs) 
         
        01:08:49:03 
                    DAVOS (OS) 
                 You think they ever met a pirate  
                 who didn’t tell them that joke? 
                        
        01:08:52:16 
                   SALLAHDOR SAAN 
                      Davos. 
              (chuckles) 
         
                SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D) 
                I heard you were rotting in a dungeon  
                in Dragonstone. 
         
        01:08:58:10 
                     DAVOS 
                    Only half rotted. 
                        
        01:09:00:23 
              
              (laughs) 
         
             Saan reaches out to shake Davos’ hand. 
              
        01:09:03:11 
                   SALLAHDOR SAAN

                    This is Lhara. 
                        
             Saan squeezes the women.

                      LHARA 
                     I am Lhara.

                 She’s an artist, this one, truly.  
                        
        01:09:15:23 
                     DAVOS 
               No time, I’m afraid. We sail at sunrise. 
                        
        01:09:19:02 
                   SALLAHDOR SAAN 
                      We? 
                        
        01:09:20:16 
                     DAVOS 
                    You, me-- we.

        01:09:24:28 
                   SALLAHDOR SAAN 
                Once I thought this man loved me. 
         
               SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                 Now I know he despises me. 
                        
               SALLAHDOR SAAN (CONT’D - OS) 
                He wants to see me die poor and alone  
                on some cold--  
                        
             Davos throws down a wallet in front of Saan.  
             The men look at each other.  
                        
                       13 
                        
        01:09:46:17 
                     DAVOS 
                   You wont be alone. 
         
                   DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                  And you won’t be poor. 
                        
             Saan opens the wallet and takes out coins. 
                        
                   DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                There’s a chest of the good stuff left back  
                at your house. 
                        
                   DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                   I gave it to your wife.

                 You’re not my friend, my friend.

               (laughs) 
         
             Davos gets up to leave. 
              
                   SALLAHDOR SAAN  
                   I’ll see you at sunrise.

             Missandei looks to Daenerys. 
              
                    MISSANDEI 
                 It was your dragons, he says. 
                        
                 MISSANDEI (CONT’D - OS) 
                They came this morning for his flock.

        01:21:01:04 
                    MISSANDEI 
               He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, 
                        
                  MISSANDEI (CONT’D) 
                  but now he has nothing. 
                        
        01:21:06:06 
                     DAENERYS 
               Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship.

                 I cannot bring back his goats,  
                        
        01:21:12:04 
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                 but, I will see he is paid their value  
                 three times over. 
                        
        01:21:19:01 
         
             The goatherd bows. 
         
             (speaking low Valyrian) 
              
             The goatherd grabs up his bundle and leaves as Missandei and 
             Daenerys look on smiling. 
                        
                     DAENERYS 
                   Send the next one in. 
                        
        01:21:43:00 
         
             A nobleman and his servant enter the hall.

                 an audience with the Queen.

                  can speak to me himself. 
                        
             The servant steps to the side. 
              
        01:22:09:16 
             The nobleman moves toward Daenerys’ throne and bows.

                    Queen Daenerys. 
                        
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
              Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated. 
                        
        01:22:13:11 
              
             Daenerys smiles. 
                        
                     DAENERYS 
                     I thank you. 
                        
        01:22:15:15 
                    HIZDAHR (OS) 
                 Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families  
                 in Meereen. 
                        
        01:22:18:16 
                     DAENERYS 
                Then it is my honor to receive you. 
                       31 
        01:22:21:06 
                     HIZDAHR 
              My father, one of Meereen’s most respected 
                        
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
              and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration

                   This pyramid included. 
                        
        01:22:31:02 
                     DAENERYS 
                 For that, he has my gratitude. 
                        
             Daenerys extends her hand and smiles. 
              
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                I should be honored to meet him. 
                        
        01:22:34:27 
                     HIZDAHR 
                   You have Your Grace. 
                        
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
                   You crucified him. 
         
             Daenerys stops smiling. 
              
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
                 I pray you’ll never live to see  
                 a member of your family treated so cruelly. 
         
        01:22:44:17 
                     DAENERYS 
               Your father crucified innocent children. 
                        
                     HIZDAHR 
                 My father spoke out  
                 against crucifying those children. 
                        
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
                 He decried it as a criminal act,  
                 but was overruled. 
                       32 
        01:22:54:19 
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
              Is it justice to answer one crime with another? 
                        
        01:22:58:00 
                     DAENERYS 
               I am sorry you no longer have a father, 
                        
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                 but my treatment of the masters  
                 was no crime. 
                        
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                 You’d be wise to remember that. 
         
        01:23:06:26 
                     HIZDAHR 
                   What’s done is done. 
                        
             Nobleman reaches out his hands and brings his fingertips 
             together. 
                        
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
                 You are the queen 
                  and I am a servant of Meereen. 
                        
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
                 A servant who does not wish 
                  to see its traditions eradicated. 
                        
        01:23:16:22 
                     DAENERYS 
                And what traditions do you speak of? 
                        
        01:23:19:20 
                    HIZDAHR (OS) 
                  The tradition of funeral rite. 
                        
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
               Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. 
                        
                 HIZDAHR (CONT’D - OS) 
                My father and 162 noble Meereenese  
                        
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
                 are still nailed to those posts, 
                       33 
        01:23:30:24 
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
               carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun. 
                        
             The nobleman bows to his knees. 
              
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
                 Your Grace, I ask that you order these men  
                 taken down 
                        
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
               so that they might receive proper burials. 
                        
        01:23:48:14 
                   DAENERYS (OS) 
                 And what of the slave children  
                 these noble Meereenese crucified? 
                        
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                They were rotting in the sun as well. 
                        
                 DAENERYS (CONT’D - OS) 
                 Would you have begged me for their right  
                 to a proper burial? 
                        
        01:23:58:15 
                     HIZDAHR 
                 Your Grace, I cannot defend 
                 the actions of the masters. 
                        
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
                 I can only speak to you as a son who 
                 loved his father. 
                        
                 HIZDAHR (CONT’D - OS) 
                  Let me take his body down. 
                        
        01:24:07:27 
                 HIZDAHR (CONT’D - OS) 
                 Let me have him brought 
                 to the temple 
                        
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
                  and buried with dignity 
                        
                        
                       34 
                   HIZDAHR (CONT’D) 
                 so that he might find  
                 peace in the next world. 
                        
        01:24:17:26 
                     DANERYS 
                    Bury your father, 
                    Hizdahr zo Loraq. 
         
        01:24:25:07 
         
             The nobleman nods his head in gratitude. 
         
                     HIZDAHR 
                   Thank you, my queen. 
                        
             Daenerys nods. The nobleman rises and leaves. 
                        
        01:23:39:29 
                     DAENERYS 
                    How many more? 
                        
        01:24:41:15 
                    MISSANDEI 
                 There are 212 supplicants 
                 waiting, Your Grace.

                     DAENERYS 
                      212? 
                        
             Daenerys looks to Jorah. He shrugs. 
                        
                     DAENERYS 
                   Send the next one in.

             INT. CASTERLY ROCK – DAY. 
         
             Oberyn sits across a table from Mace, Pycelle, Varys and 
             Cersei. 
         
                     OBERYN 
                 These meetings aren’t always going to be  
                 this early, are they? 
                        
                       35 
                  OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                   I was up late last night. 
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                 So, does this mean I am a master  
                 of something now? 
                        
                   OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                     Coins, ships? 
                        
        01:25:11:10 
                      MACE 
                Lord Tywin and I already determined 
                        
        01:25:13:19 
                   MACE (CONT’D) 
                 that I shall be the Master of Ships 
                 long before you--  
                        
             Tywin enters. All stand to greet him except Cersei and Oberyn. 
                        
                    MACE (CONT’D 
                 Lord Tywin, it’s a great honor 
                        
                   MACE (CONT’D) 
              to have been granted a seat on this council. I-- 
                        
             Tywin sits down at the head of the table. All sit. 
                        
        01:25:26:10 
                      TYWIN 
                 The trial begins this afternoon.

                   OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                  You did like boys before? 
                        
             Varys shakes his head. 
         
                   OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                      Really? 
                        
                   OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                     Girls? Hmm. 
                        
                   OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 I hope you won’t be offended when I say 
                 I never would have guessed. 
                        
        01:29:26:23 
                      VARYS 
                     Not at all.

                   VARYS (CONT’D) 
               But I was never interested in girls, either. 
         
        01:29:31:08 
                     OBERYN 
                     What then? 
                        
                    VARYS (OS) 
                     Nothing. 
                        
                     OBERYN 
                Everybody is interested in something. 
                        
                    VARYS (OS) 
                      Not me.

                   VARYS (CONT’D) 
               When I see what desire does to people, 
                        
                   VARYS (CONT’D) 
                 what it’s done to this country,

                I am very glad I have no part in it. 
                        
                  VARYS (CONT’D - OS) 
                 Besides, the absence of desire 
                        
                   VARYS (CONT’D) 
                leaves one free to pursue other things.

                     OBERYN 
                     Such as? 
                        
             Varys looks to the throne and exits. Oberyn turns to look at the 
             throne.

             INT. CASTERLY ROCK DUNGEON – DAY. 
         
             (keys clinking) 
              
              
                       44 
             Jaime nods to guard to let him enter. He moves to Tyrion. 
              
                     TYRION 
                Let me guess, I’ve been pardoned. 
                        
            Jaime nods to guards. Guards move to Tyrion and put him in 
            irons. Tyrion looks quizzical and then caustic.  
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                      Really? 
                        
                      JAIME 
                    Father’s orders. 
                        
                     TYRION 
                Well, we mustn’t disappoint Father. 
         
        01:31:03:10 
                  INT. CASTERLY ROCK THRONE ROOM – DAY. 
         
             Jaime and Tyrion enter the hall, filled with a crowd, and 
             approach the throne, escorted by two guards. 
              
             (crowd murmuring) 
              
        01:31:07:29 
                      MAN 
                     Kingslayer! 
                        
             Tyrion looks back the man and keeps walking. Tyrion gets to 
             the stand and the guards remove his irons. Jaime looks to the 
             throne. Tyrion looks around. 
                        
        01:31:55:27 
         
             Tywin stands at Tommen’s side. Tommen rises. All rise and 
             look to Tommen. 
         
                     TOMMEN 
                I, Tommen of the House Baratheon,  
                        
                  TOMMEN (CONT’D - OS) 
                    First of my Name,  
                        
                  TOMMEN (CONT’D - OS)

                   TOMMEN (CONT’D) 
                and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, 
                        
                   TOMMEN (CONT’D) 
               do hereby recuse myself from this trial. 
                        
                   TOMMEN (CONT’D) 
                 Tywin of the House Lannister, 
                    Hand of the King, 
                        
                   TOMMEN (CONT’D) 
                   Protector of the Realm, 
                 will sit as judge in my stead. 
         
        01:32:17:25 
                  TOMMEN (CONT’D - OS) 
             And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell 
                        
                  TOMMEN (CONT’D - OS) 
                and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell. 
                        
                   TOMMEN (CONT’D) 
                   And if found guilty… 
                        
             Tyrion closes his eyes. 
                        
                   TOMMEN (CONT’D) 
                may the gods punish the accused. 
         
             Tyrion looks up to Tommen and nods slightly. Tommen exits 
             with guards. Jaime nods to them as they go. 
              
             Mace and Oberyn join Tywin at the throne. Tywin takes the 
             throne. The others seated at his sides. All sit. 
         
        01:33:06:00 
                      TYWIN 
                 Tyrion of the House Lannister, 
         
                   TYWIN (CONT’D) 
             you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. 
                        
                   TYWIN (CONT’D) 
                  Did you kill King Joffrey? 
                        
                       46 
        01:33:17:14 
                     TYRION 
                       No. 
                        
                      TYWIN 
                 Did your wife, the Lady Sansa? 
                        
                     TYRION 
                   Not that I know of. 
                        
                      TYWIN 
                How would you say he died then? 
                        
        01:33:26:26 
                     TYRION 
                  Choked on his pigeon pie. 
                        
                 Jaime shoots a glance at Tywin. 
                        
                      TYWIN 
                 So you would blame the bakers? 
                        
                     TYRION 
                    Or the pigeons.  
                   Just leave me out of it. 
                        
             Tyrion looks at Cersei. 
                        
        01:33:35:02 
             (crowd murmuring) 
              
                      TYWIN 
                The crown may call its first witness. 
                        
        01:33:41:01 
                  MERYN TRANT (OS) 
               Once we’d got King Joffrey safely away 
                        
        01:33:43:03 
                MERYN TRANT (CONT’D - OS) 
                from the mob, the Imp rounded him. 
                        
                MERYN TRANT (CONT’D - OS) 
                He slapped the king across the face 
                        
                        
                       47 
                 MERYN TRANT (CONT’D) 
               and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. 
         
        01:33:49:29 
              
             Tyrion sits accused with his head down.  
              
             (crowd gasps) 
         
                MERYN TRANT (CONT’D - OS) 
                 It wasn’t the first time the Imp  
                 threatened Joffrey. 
                        
                 MERYN TRANT (CONT’D) 
                 Right here in this throne room, 
                        
                 MERYN TRANT (CONT’D) 
              he marched up those steps and called our king 
              a halfwit. 
                        
                MERYN TRANT (CONT’D - OS) 
               Compared His Grace to the Mad King. 
                        
                MERYN TRANT (CONT’D - OS) 
               and suggested he’s meet the same fate. 
         
        01:34:02:21 
                 MERYN TRANT (CONT’D) 
               And when I spoke in the king’s defense, 
                        
             Meryn turns to face Tyrion. 
              
                 MERYN TRANT (CONT’D) 
                 he threatened to have me killed. 
         
        01:34:06:27 
         
             Tyrion looks to the throne. 
              
                     TYRION 
                 Oh, why don’t you tell  
                 them what Joffrey was doing? 
                        
        01:34:09:09 
                    TYWIN (OS) 
                      Silence. 
                       48 
                     TYRION 
               Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark 
         
        01:34:11:25 
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
               while you tore her clothes and beat her. 
                        
        01:34:13:18 
                      TYWIN 
                      Silence! 
                        
                   TYWIN (CONT’D) 
               You will not speak unless called upon. 
                        
                   TYWIN (CONT’D) 
                 You’re dismissed, Ser Meryn. 
                        
             Meryn steps down, smirks at Tyrion and leaves.

                By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, 
                        
             Tyrion looks innervated. 
         
                  PYCELLE (CONT’D - OS) 
               after he had me wrongfully imprisoned. 
                        
             Pycelle turns to glare at Tyrion. 
                        
                    TYWIN (OS) 
                    Grand Maester, 
                        
                   TYWIN (CONT’D) 
                you examined King Joffrey’s corpse. 
                        
                   TYWIN (CONT’D) 
              Was it without question poison that killed him? 
                        
                        
                       50 
        01:35:16:20 
                     PYCELLE 
                    Without question. 
                        
        01:35:19:08 
             (crowd murmuring) 
         
                   PYCELLE (CONT’D) 
              This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard,  
                        
             Pycelle reaches into his sleeve and pulls out Sansa’s necklace. 
         
                   PYCELLE (CONT’D) 
                    the king’s fool. 
                        
                   PYCELLE (CONT’D) 
               He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, 
                        
        01:35:30:26 
         
                   PYCELLE (CONT’D) 
              the wife of the accused, away from the feast. 
                        
                   PYCELLE (CONT’D) 
                   She wore this necklace  
                        
             Pycelle shows the necklace. Margaery looks on. 
         
                  PYCELLE (CONT’D - OS) 
                  the day of the wedding. 
                        
             Cersei closes her eyes and looks sullen, but stonefaced.  
                        
                  PYCELLE (CONT’D - OS) 
                   Residue of a most rare 
                        
                  PYCELLE (CONT’D - OS) 
                and terrible poison was found inside. 
                        
        01:35:47:19 
                      TYWIN 
                  Was this one of the poisons  
                   stolen from your store? 
                        
                     PYCELLE 
                   It was. The Strangler. 
                       51 
                        
                   PYCELLE (CONT’D) 
              A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. 
                        
                  PYCELLE (CONT’D - OS) 
              And used to strike down the most noble child 
                        
                   PYCELLE (CONT’D) 
                the gods ever put on this good earth. 
                        
             Pycelle glares at Tyrion. Tyrion looks to the floor. 
         
        01:36:06:20 
             (crowd murmuring) 
              
        01:36:13:29 
         
             Pan out of Cersei’s empty seat. Cersei is on the witness stand. 
         
                    CERSEI (OS) 
                  “I will hurt you for this. 
                        
                  CERSEI (CONT’D - OS) 
                 A day will come when you think  
                 you are safe and happy 
                        
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                 and your joy will turn to ashes  
                 in your mouth 
                        
        01:36:21:17 
         
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                and you will know the debt is paid.” 
                        
                      MACE 
                Your own brother said this to you? 
                        
             Cersei nods at Mace. 
                        
                     CERSEI 
              Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. 
                        
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                 I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey 
                 on the front lines. 
                       52 
                        
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
               As it turned out, when the attack came 
                        
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
              Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. 
                        
                  CERSEI (CONT’D - OS) 
                 He believed his presence would  
                 inspire the troops. 
         
             Tyrion continues with his head in his hand. 
         
        01:36:47:14 
                     OBERYN 
                     Tyrion said, 
                        
                   OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                “And you will know the debt is paid.” 
                        
                   OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                     What debt? 
                        
                     CERSEI 
               I discovered he’d been keeping whores 
                        
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                  in the Tower of the Hand. 
                        
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
               I asked him to confine his salacious acts 
                        
             Jaime looks on at Cersei. 
                        
                  CERSEI (CONT’D - OS) 
              to the brothel where such behavior belongs. 
                        
        01:37:04:12 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                    He wasn’t pleased 
                        
                      MACE 
                  Thank you, Your Grace, 
                        
                   MACE (CONT’D) 
                for the courage of your testimony. 
                       53 
              
             Margaery crosses her arms and leans back. Cersei steps down 
             and returns to her seat. 
                        
        01:37:29:06 
         
                  MACE (CONT’D - OS) 
             Do you remember the precise nature of this threat? 
                        
                    VARYS (OS) 
                  I’m afraid I do, my lord. 
                        
                  VARYS (CONT’D - OS) 
                 He said, “Perhaps you should speak  
                 more softly to me, then. 
                        
             Varys is on the witness stand. 
         
                   VARYS (CONT’D) 
                  Monsters are dangerous 
                        
                   VARYS (CONT’D) 
               and just now kings are dying like flies.” 
                        
        10:37:42:18 
                      MACE 
                And he said this to you at a meeting 
                   of the small council? 
                        
                      VARYS 
                      Yes. 
                        
                   VARYS (CONT’D) 
              After we received word of Robb Stark’s death. 
                        
                   VARYS (CONT’D) 
               He didn’t seem gladdened by the news. 
                        
                   VARYS (CONT’D) 
                Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark 
                        
                   VARYS (CONT’D) 
                 had made him more sympathetic  
                 to the northern cause.

        01:38:01:20 
                      TYWIN 
                 You’re excused, Lord Varys. 
                        
             Varys nods and steps down. 
         
                     TYRION 
              Father, may I ask the witness one question? 
                        
             Varys stops by the accused. 
         
                      TYWIN 
                      One. 
                        
                     TYRION 
                    You once said  
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 that without me, this city would have faced  
                 certain defeat. 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 You said the histories would never  
                 mention me, 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  but you would not forget. 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                Have you forgotten, Lord Varys? 
                        
        01:38:38:19 
                      VARYS 
                    Sadly, my lord,  
                        
                   VARYS (CONT’D) 
                   I never forget a thing. 
                        
             Varys bows and exits. 
                        
                      TYWIN 
                  We will adjourn for now. 
                        
                       55 
             Tywin, Mace, and Oberyn rise. 
         
                   TYWIN (CONT’D) 
                 Toll the bells in an hour’s time. 
                        
        01:38:59:14 
                     GUARD 
                    Clear the court! 
                        
             All rise. Cersei and Jaime look at each other. 
         
        01:39:10:16 
             (crowd chatting) 
              
             Jaime exits. All exit except Tyrion, who sits in chains. 
              
        01:39:21:20 
             INT. CASTERLY ROCK DINING HALL - DAY 
                        
             Tywin sits eating as Jaime stands addressing him.  
         
                     JAIME (OS) 
               You’d condemn your own son to death? 
                        
                      TYWIN 
                 I’ve condemned no one. 
                 The trial is not over. 
                        
                      JAIME 
                 This isn’t a trial. It’s a farce. 
                        
                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
                 Cersei has manipulated everything  
                 and you know it. 
                        
                      TYWIN 
                  I know nothing of the sort. 
                        
        01:39:31:21 
                      JAIME 
                 You’ve always hated Tyrion. 
                        
                      TYWIN 
                   He killed his king. 
                        
                        
                       56 
                      JAIME 
                     As did I. 
                        
                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
                 Do you know the last order the Mad King  
                 gave me? 
                        
                  JAIME (CONT’D - OS) 
                  To bring him your head. 
                        
                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
                 I saved your life so you could murder  
                 my brother? 
                        
        01:39:44:05 
                      TYWIN 
                It won’t be murder. It’ll be justice. 
                        
                     JAIME (OS) 
                      Justice? 
                        
        01:39:46:21

             (bell tolling) 
         
             Jaime exits. Tywin takes a drink.

             INT. CASTERLY ROCK THRONE ROOM – DAY. 
         
             Tyrion sits chained to the stand. Jaime enters and approaches 
             him. 
              
                     TYRION 
                   Not going well, is it? 
                        
        01:41:54:07 
                      JAIME 
                 You’re going to be found guilty. 
                        
                     TYRION 
                    Oh, you think so? 
                        
                      JAIME 
                 When you are, you need to enter

                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
                 and ask to be sent to the Wall. 
                        
                  JAIME (CONT’D - OS) 
                   Father’s agreed to it. 
                        
                        
                       60

        01:42:06:19 
                     TYRION 
               Ned Stark was promised the same thing. 
                        
                  TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
               and we both know how that turned out. 
                        
             Cersei enters. 
         
                     JAIME (OS) 
               Father is not Joffrey.  He’ll keep his word. 
                        
                     TYRION 
                   How do you know? 
         
             Tywin enters. All look to him. Jaime looks back to Tyrion. 
         
        01:42:18:22 
                      JAIME 
                    Do you trust me? 
                        
        Tywin looks to Jaime and nods. 
         
                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
               Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. 
                        
                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
                  This will all be over soon. 
                        
             Jaime leaves Tyrion’s side and goes back to his corner. Cersei 
             looks on. All are seated. 
         
        01:42:44:04 
                      TYWIN 
                The crown may call its next witness.

             (footsteps) 
              
             Tyrion stands up. His jaw drops.  Shae enters and Tyrion tracks 
             her with his eyes as she approaches the stand. 
              
                       61

                   TYWIN (CONT’D) 
                 that your testimony will be

                  Do you know this man? 
                        
             Shae looks at Tyrion and turns back to Tywin.

                   Yes. Tyrion Lannister.

                      TYWIN 
                 And how do you know him? 
                        
        01:43:47:27 
                     SHAE (OS) 
               I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa. 
                        
                      TYWIN 
                 This man stands accused of murdering  
                 King Joffrey. 
                        
                   TYWIN (CONT’D) 
                  What do you know of this?

                      SHAE 
                   I know that he’s guilty. 
                        
             Tyrion rises. 
                       62

                      SHAE (CONT’D) 
                   He and Sansa planned it together. 
         
        01:44:06:11 
                    TYWIN (OS) 
                      Silence! 
                        
             Tyrion sits down. 
         
                  TYWIN (CONT’D - OS) 
                     Continue.

                She wanted revenge for her father,

                  SHAE (CONT’D - OS) 
                She blamed their deaths on the king. 
                        
             Cersei glares at Tyrion. 
                        
        01:44:18:17 
                  SHAE (CONT’D - OS) 
                  Tyrion was happy to help. 
                        
                  SHAE (CONT’D - OS) 
                He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. 
                        
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
                   He hated you, my lord.

             Margaery looks on disturbed. 
                        
                    OBERYN (OS) 
               How could you possibly know all this? 
                        
                   OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 Why would he reveal such plans  
                 to his wife’s maid? 
                        
        01:44:40:25 
                      SHAE 
                   I wasn’t just her maid. 
                        
             Oberyn looks at Shae questioningly. 
                        
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
                    I was his whore.

                   I beg your pardon?

                      MACE 
                  You said you were his…

                      SHAE 
                     His whore. 
                        
                    TYWIN (OS) 
               How did you come to be in his service? 
                        
                      SHAE 
                     He stole me. 
                        
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
                  I was with another man,  
                        
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
                 a knight in your lordship’s army. 
                        
                        
                       64 
        01:45:04:07 
                      SHAE 
                But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, 
                        
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
                 he sent one of his cutthroats  
                 into our tent. 
                        
                  SHAE (CONT’D - OS) 
                 He broke the knight’s arm and brought me 
                  to Lord Tyrion. 
                        
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
                “You belong to me now,” he said. 
                        
        01:45:16:03 
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
           “I want you to fuck me like it’s my last night in this world.” 
                        
             Tyrion looks down in anger and disgrace.

                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
                Whatever he told me to do to him. 
                        
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
                Whatever he felt like doing to me. 
         
             Tyrion grows increasingly aggravated and looks to the floor. 
         
                  SHAE (CONT’D - OS) 
                 I kissed him where he wanted. 
                        
        01:45:44:16 
                  SHAE (CONT’D - OS) 
                 I licked him where he wanted. 
                        
                  SHAE (CONT’D - OS) 
               I let him put himself where he wanted. 
         
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
                   I was his property. 
                        
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
               I would wait in his chambers for hours 
                        
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
               so he could use me when he was bored. 
         
        01:45:55:11 
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
                 He ordered me to call him “my lion,”  
                 so I did. 
                        
        01:45:59:09 
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
                I took his face in my hands and said, 
                        
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
                 “I am yours and you are mine.”

                      Shae. 
         
             Shae looks back at Tyrion pleading. 
         
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     Please don’t.

                  SHAE (CONT’D - OS) 
                     Remember? 
                        
             Tyrion clenches his jaw. Shae resumes facing the court.

                That was before he married Sansa. 
                        
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
                After that, all he wanted was her. 
                        
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
                But she wouldn’t let him into her bed. 
                        
                    SHAE (CONT’D) 
              So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.

                     I saved you.

                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  and all your worthless lives.

                I should have let Stannis kill you all.

                     TYRION 
                     Yes, Father.

                     I’m guilty.

                Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?

                      TYWIN 
                You admit you poisoned the king?

                     TYRION 
                  No, of that I’m innocent. 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
               I’m guilty of a far more monstrous crime. 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 I am guilty of being a dwarf. 
                        
        01:47:47:29 
                      TYWIN 
               You are not on trial for being a dwarf.

                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    I did not do it.

                  TYRION (CONT’D – OS) 
                And I know I’ll get no justice here.
