                         do his job while he’s off fucking boars
                         and hunting whores. Or is it the other
                         way around? And life will go on.

                        Well, you’re always welcome on the Wall.

                        giving up. We have no families. None

                   You are the bastard though.

                   Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
                            TYRION
                   And Lady Stark is not your mother.
                   Making you the bastard. Let me give you
                   some advice bastard. Never forget what
                   you are. The rest of the world will
                   not. Wear it like armor, and it can

                                   JAIME
                        It’s alright. It’s alright. It’s
                        alright.

                        I heard you the first time.
               JAIME LOOKS DOWN TO THE DOG BUT IS STILL HOLDING BRAN
               AGAINST THE WALL.
                                   JAIME
                        Quite the little climber aren’t you?
                        How old are you boy?
                                   BRAN
                        Ten.

                        The things I do for love.
               JAIME PUSHES BRAN OUT THE WINDOW. BRAN FALLS TO THE
               GROUND.
