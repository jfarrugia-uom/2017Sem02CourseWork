           INT. STORMLANDS - RENLY'S TENT - NIGHT. 
            
           The wind whips the flaps of the tent.  Renly sits behind his 
           table.  Brienne is by his side.  Catelyn sits in front of 
           him. 
            
                          RENLY 
                   You swear it? 
                    
                          CATELYN 
                   By the mother.  My son has no interest 
                   in the Iron Throne. 
                    
                          RENLY 
                   Then I see no reason for hostility 
                   between us.  Your son can go on calling 
                   himself King of the North.  The Starks 
                   will have dominion over all lands north 
                   of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an 
                   oath of fealty. 
                    
                          CATELYN 
                   And the wording of this oath? 
                    
                          RENLY 
                   The same Ned Stark swore to Robert 
                   eighteen years ago.  Cat, their 
                   friendship held the kingdoms together. 
                    
                          CATELYN 
                   And in return for my son's loyalty? 
                    
                          RENLY 
                   In the morning, I'll destroy my 
                   brother's army.  When that's done, 
                   Baratheon and Stark with fight their 
                   common enemy together, as they have done 
                   many times before. 
                    
                          CATELYN 
                   Our two houses have always been close, 
                   which is why I am begging you to 
                   reconsider this battle.

                   Negotiate a peace with your brother. 
                    
                          RENLY 
                   Negotiate with Stannis?  You heard him 
                   out there.  I'd have better luck 
                   debating the wind.  Please bring my 
                   terms to your son.  I believe we are 
                   natural allies.  I hope he feels the 
                   same.  Together, we could end this war 
                   in a fortnight. 
                    
           The wind howls and rips through the tent.  A dark shadow 
           enters the tent, startling Catelyn and Brienne, who gasps.  
           Renly stands near the edge of the tent.  The shadow takes 
           human form behind him and stabs him in the back with a 
           sword.  Blood gushes from Renly's chest. 
                    
                          BRIENNE 
                   No! 
                    
           Renly falls into Brienne's arms and then onto the floor.  
           Two kingsguards storm into the tent with swords drawn, but 
           it is too late. 
            
                          KINGSGUARD 1 
                   You'll die for this! 
                    
                          CATELYN 
                   No, no!  Wait!  It-it wasn’t her! 
                    
           The kingsguards go after Brienne.  She draws her sword and 
           they fight.  Brienne quickly kills both of the kingsguards.  
           Catelyn looks on, stunned.  Brienne leans over Renly and 
           cries.

           Catelyn tries to pry Brienne away from Renly.

                   Not that way. 
                    
           Brienne runs out of the tent on one side, while Catelyn runs 
           out of another opening.  Renly lies dead on the ground.

           behind him and paces.

                   was Stannis himself who did it after 
                   negotiations went sour. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   Whomever did it, I say well done. 
                    
                          TYRION 
                   It's not what Varys says.  He says 
                   Renly's army is flocking to support 
                   Stannis, which would give Stannis 
                   superiority over us on both land and 
                   sea.

                   And I say father raised you to have too 
                   much respect for money.  Stannis 
                   Baratheon is coming for us, sooner 
                   rather than later.

                   Aren't there other things you should be 
                   doing, like sealing my daughter in a 
                   crate so you can ship her away? 
                    
                          TYRION 
                   She'll be safer in Dorne. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   Yes, I know how concerned you are for 
                   her safety.

                   It so happens that I am.  Myrcella's a 
                   sweet, innocent girl and I don’t blame 
                   her at all for you. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   So clever.  Aren't you always so clever 
                   with your schemes and your plots. 
                    
           Cersei walks into another room, annoyed at Tyrion.  She sits

                          TYRION 
                   Schemes and plots are the same thing.  
                   They are going to attack us!  We need to 
                   be ready. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   No need to concern yourself over it.  
                   The king is taking personal charge of 
                   siege preparations. 
                    
                          TYRION 
                   May I ask specifically what the king has 
                   in mind? 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   You may specifically, or you may ask 
                   vaguely.  The answer will be the same. 
                    
                          TYRION 
                   It's important that we talk about this. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   It's the king's royal prerogative to 
                   withhold sensitive information from his 
                   councilors.

                   Tell me, if the vile allegations against 
                   my brother and sister are true, do you 
                   think it would make Jaime more likely to 
                   kill you or less likely?  When I tell

                   The smart money would be on more likely.

                   But then perhaps his own unnatural urges

                          STANNIS 
                   You come to lecture me on truth? 
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   I've come to tell you about what I saw. 
                    
                          STANNIS 
                   All my brothers bannermen have come to 
                   my side.  Except for Tyrell's, who fled 
                   like cowards.  They won't be able to 
                   resist us now.  Soon, I should be 
                   sitting on the Iron Throne.

                          DAVOS 
                   Nothing is worth what this will cost 
                   you.  Not even the Iron Th… 
                    
                          STANNIS 
                   I'll hear no more about it. 
                    
           The men stand in silence for a few moments before Davos 
           breaks the silence.  Stannis moves around chess pieces on a 
           board. 
            
                          DAVOS 
                   When do we sail for King's Landing? 
                    
                          STANNIS 
                   As soon as I've consolidated my troops.  
                   We'll make short work of the Lannisters' 
                   fleet.  Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, 
                   we'll deliver our armies to their 
                   doorstep and take the city. 
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   And will you bring Lady Melisandre with 
                   you? 
                    
      01:12:37 
       
                          STANNIS 
                   Well, that is not your concern. 
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   If you take King's Landing with her by 
                   your side, the victory will be hers. 
                    
                          STANNIS 
                   I never thought I'd have reason to doubt 
                   your loyalty.  Was I wrong? 
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   Loyal service means telling hard truths. 
                    
                          STANNIS 
                   Oh, truth again.  All right.  What's the 
                   truth?  The hard truth? 
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   She's a foreigner, preaching a foreign 
                   religion.  Some believe she whispers

                          DAVOS 
                   You won those bannermen from Renly.  
                   Don’t lose them to her.

                   We'll set out for King's Landing without 
                   Lady Melisandre.  And you will lead the 
                   fleet into Blackwater Bay. 
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on 
                   the sea was spent evading ships, not 
                   attacking them.  The other lords won't 
                   be happy.

                          STANNIS 
                   Most of those lords should consider 
                   themselves lucky I don't hang them for 
                   treason.  Hard truths cut both ways, Ser 
                   Davos. 
                    
           After a long moment, Davos exits the tent.  Stannis stands 
           in silence.

                   He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.  He's 
                   very busy.  Being repeatedly humiliated 
                   by Robb Stark is time consuming.  We 
                   won't be able to hold the city against

                   You could do that.  Take the ship, head 
                   out on your own.  And I will hunt you

           Yara joins the crew.

                   Stop!  We yield. 
                    
           The crew laughs with Yara. 
            
                          YARA 
                   Congratulations on your first command. 
                    
                          THEON 
                   Thank you.  Kind of you to come see me 
                   off. 
                          YARA 
                   Oh, I'm not here for you.  I was just on 
                   my way to Red Harbor.  I've got thirty 
                   ships.  There's nowhere to put them 
                   here.  Too narrow. 
                    
                          THEON 
                   Better get out there.  Wouldn’t want to 
                   set sail without you. 
                    
                          YARA 
                   That would never happen.  My crew would 
                   wait on deck for a year if I asked them 
                   to.  This lot, though...  Enjoy the 
                   Stony Shore. 
                    
           Yara walks away from Theon.  His crew is on a skiff and 
           heading out to the Sea Bitch without him as they laugh.  
           Dagmer, a member of the crew, has stayed behind.  He 
           approaches Theon. 
            
                          DAGMER 
                   Come on.  I'll take you out.

                   Dagmer, your first mate. 
                    
           Theon follows Dagmer. 
                    
                          THEON 
                   Aren't you with the rest of them?  Or 
                   did they send you?  Did they send you to 
                   row me out and dump me halfway in the 
                   sea?  That would be good for a laugh.

                   prove yourself. 
                    
                          THEON 
                   And how am I supposed to prove myself by 
                   pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?

                   You're not. 
                    
                          THEON 
                   And yet that's the task my father has 
                   given me to prove that I am a true Iron 
                   Islander. 
                    
                          DAGMER 
                   They're all Iron Islanders.  Do they do 
                   as they're told or they do as they like?

                   Oh, we could.  But we could never hold 
                   it for more than a few days.  As soon as 
                   Winterfell got word that we'd taken

           Tywin sits at a table with his generals and Amory.  Arya 
           prepares food for the men. 
            
                          GENERAL #1 
                   The Starks have over-extended their 
                   lines.  Now that summer's over, they'll 
                   have a hard time keeping their men and 
                   horses fed. 
                    
                          TYWIN 
                   The Starks understand winter better than 
                   we ever will.  The cold won't beat them. 
                    
                          AMORY 
                   Our spies report growing discontent 
                   among the northern lords.  They want to 
                   return home and gather the harvest 
                   before the crops turn. 
                    
                          TYWIN 
                   And I'm sure if those same spies snuck 
                   into our own encampments, they would 
                   report growing discontent amongst the 
                   southern lords.  This is war.  No one's 
                   content.  We've underestimated the Stark 
                   boy for too long.  He has a good mind 
                   for warfare.  His men worship him.  And 
                   as long as he keeps winning battles,

                   So now how do we stop him? 
                    
                          GENERAL #1 
                   We've worked through the night, My Lord.  
                   Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep. 
                    
                          TYWIN 
                   Yes, I think you would, Reginald.  And 
                   because you're my cousin, I might even 
                   let you wake from that sleep.  Go!  I'm 
                   sure your wife must miss you. 
                    
                          GENERAL #1 
                   My wife's in Lannisport. 
                    
                          TYWIN 
                   Well then you better start riding.  Go 
                   before I change my mind and send her 
                   your head. 
                    
           The general stands, shocked.   
            
                          TYWIN 
                   If your name wasn’t Lannister, you'd be 
                   scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent.  
                   Go! 
                    
           The general exits.  The men sitting around the table do not 
           move.  Arya walks over to the table to refill the generals' 
           wine cups.

                   some time.

           back.

                   A red salmon.  I think a Maidenpool girl 
                   would remember that.  You're a

                   And what do they say of Robb Stark in

           Arya walks though the corridor carrying a jug of water.  
           Four Lannister guards walk toward her down the corridor.

                   girl.  And only death may pay for life.  
                   You saved me and two I was with.  You 
                   stole three deaths from the Red God.  We 
                   have to give them back.  Speak three

                   My uncle told me stories about him.

                   The First of the First Men.  Think of 
                   how old this place is.  Before the

                   the Andals took Westeros from the First

                   the First Men stood here, where we're

                   something.  And I don’t think it worked.

                   The substance is fire given form, and we 
                   have been perfecting it since the days 
                   of Maegor.

                   The jars are put in catapults and flung 
                   at the enemy.

                   If you get real soldiers to man the 
                   catapults, then maybe you'd hit your 
                   target one time in ten.  But all the 
                   real soldiers are in the Riverlands with 
                   your father.

                   I don’t know if you've ever seen a 
                   battle, old man, but things could get a 
                   bit messy, 'cause when we're flinging 
                   things at Stannis, he's flinging them 
                   right back at us.  Men die.  Men shit 
                   themselves.  Men run.  Which means pots 
                   falling, which means fire inside the 
                   wall, which means the poor cunts trying 
                   to defend the city end up burning it 
                   down.

           INT. XARO'S PALACE - DANY'S CHAMBER - QARTH - DAY. 
            
           Dany and Doreah lean on the ledge and admire the dragons. 
            
                          DANY 
                   Drakaris.  Drakaris. 
                    
           The baby dragon opens its mouth and spreads its wings as if 
           communicating with Dany and Doreah. 
                    
                          DOREAH

                   He'll be able to feed himself from now 
                   on.  Let him sleep, Doreah. 
                    
                          DOREAH 
                   Yes, khaleesi. 
                    
           Doreah holds out her hand and the baby dragon climbs on.  
           Dany stands with Irri and inspects her work as Doreah moves 
           the dragons' cage. 
            
                          DANY

                   Did you see the dress Xaro had made for 
                   you? They say he's the wealthiest man in 
                   Qarth.  
                    
           Doreah holds up a dress to show Dany. 
            
                          IRRI 
                   It is known. 
                    
                          DOREAH 
                   And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in 
                   Essos... 
                    
                          DANY 
                   The last time a rich man gave me a 
                   dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo. 
                    
                          IRRI 
                   Me dothraliatés she Rháeshi Ájjaláni

                   May he ride forever through the night 
                   lands. 
                    
           Dany and Doreah turn their attention to Irri for a moment, 
           but then continue on with their conversation without 
           responding. 
            
                          DANY 
                   Xaro is our host, but we know nothing 
                   about him.  Men like to talk about other 
                   men when they're happy. 
                    
                          DOREAH 
                   Oh. 
                    
           Doreah smiles and turns away.

                          DANY 
                   You would look like a real princess in 
                   Xaros. 
                    
                          IRRI 
                   She's not a princess.  She's a khaleesi. 
                    
           Dany, Doreah and Irri exchange looks.  The dragons squawk.

           Irri walks out of the room.  Dany smiles. 
            
            
           EXT. QARTH - XARO'S PALACE - COURTYARD - LATER. 
            
           The party is in full swing.  Dany wears the blue dress given 
           to her as a gift by Xaro.   
            
                          FEMALE PARTY GUEST 
                   (LAUGH)  And you must visit the night 
                   market, because here night market is 
                   like no night market you've ever seen. 
                    
                          DANY 
                   It sounds wonderful. 
                    
                          FEMALE PARTY GUEST 
                   Mm.  The Marinesti [PH], they have a 
                   night market.  I will take you there 
                   myself. 
                    
           Dany notices Kovarro and Jorah among the crowd. 
            
                          DANY 
                   Please excuse me for a minute. 
                    
           Dany quickly walks over to Jorah, Kovarro and another man 
           standing by a gold statue.  Kovarro taps the statue with a 
           blade.

                          JORAH 
                   Well Mallaco [PH] says the statue is too 
                   heavy to carry.  Kovarro says that 
                   Mallacco is an idiot.  They can pry out 
                   the gems.  The rest is pure gold.  Very 
                   soft.  He can chop off as much as we can

           Kovarro and the man walk away from Dany and Jorah, resigned.  
           They stroll through the courtyard together. 
            
                          DANY 
                   My brother used to say the only thing a 
                   Dothraki knew how to do was steal things 
                   better men have built. 
                    
                          JORAH 
                   It's not the only thing.  They're quite 
                   good at killing the better men. 
                    
                          DANY 
                   That's not the kind of queen I'm going 
                   to be. 
                    
           A bald warlock approaches Dany and Jorah.  He introduces 
           himself and bows. 
            
                          WARLOCK 1 
                   The Mother of Dragons.  On behalf of the 
                   Warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. 
                    
           The warlock holds out his hand to Dany.  He places a gem in 
           her hand. 
                    
      01:34:48 
                          WARLOCK 1 
                   A demonstration.  Take this gem.  Look 
                   at it.  Into its depths.  So many 
                   facets.  Look closely enough and you can 
                   see yourself in them. 
                    
      [MUSIC IN] 
       
           A warlock twin stands among the crowd.  The crowd gasps. 
            
                          WARLOCK 2 
                   Often more than once.

                   Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles 
                   and trinkets, it would be an honor to 
                   host you at the House of the Undying.  
                   You are always welcome, Mother of 
                   Dragons. 
                    
           The warlocks walk away.  The crowd applauds.  Xaros 
           approaches.

                          XARO 
                   My apologies.  Bi Pree [PH] is one of 
                   the thirteen.  It was customary for me 
                   to extend him an invitation.  Customs 
                   die slow deaths in Qarth.

                   What is the House of the Undying? 
                    
                          XARO 
                   It is where the warlocks go to squint at 
                   dusty books and drink Shade of the 
                   Evening.  It turns their lips blue and 
                   their minds soft.  So soft they actually 
                   believe their parlor tricks are magic.

           Xaro leads Dany away from the crowd.  Jorah looks on. 
            
      01:36:03 
                          WOMAN (OS) 
                   You watch over her.

                   Do I know you? 
                    
           Jorah turns to find a woman standing there with her face 
           covered by black and gold netting. 
            
                          WOMAN 
                   I know you.  Jorah Mormont of Bear

                   I'm no one.  But she is the Mother of 
                   Dragons.  She needs true protectors, now 
                   more than ever.  I shall come day and 
                   night to see the wonder born into the 
                   world again.  And when they see, they 
                   shall lust.  Her dragons are fire made 
                   flesh, and fire is power.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF STORMLANDS - DAY. 
            
           Catelyn and Brienne stand in the forest with Brienne's 
           horse. 
            
                          BRIENNE 
                   It looked like Stannis. 
                    
                          CATELYN 
                   To me, it just looked like a shadow in 
                   the shape of a man. 
                    
                          BRIENNE 
                   In the shape of Stannis. 
                    
                          CATELYN 
                   We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.

                   Will you stay there long, my Lady? 
                    
                          CATELYN 
                   Only long enough to tell Robb what I 
                   have seen.  After that, I will leave for 
                   Winterfell.  My two youngest need me.  
                   I've been away from them for far too 
                   long. 
                    
                          BRIENNE 
                   I never knew my mother. 
                    
                          CATELYN 
                   I'm sorry.  My own mother died on the 
                   birthing bed when I was very young.   
                    
           Catelyn and Brienne walk over to a small fire.  Catelyn sits 
           down. 
            
                          BRIENNE 
                   It's a bloody business. 
                    
                          CATELYN 
                   What comes after is even harder.

                   and no one by following him into the 
                   earth.  Renly's enemies are Robb's

           lays the sword on the ground and bows.

                   My wife always prayed for more children.  
                   We'll look after them.  Thank you, My

           Farmer #1 exits the room.  Bran turns to Rickon who 
           continues to crush walnuts on the table.

                   Most of the fighting men are away with 
                   Robb, but I can gather two hundred 
                   decent men.

           HOdor walks through the empty courtyard with Bran on his

                          BRAN 
                   I did ask him.  He never heard of a

                          OSHA 
                   Must not mean anything, then.

           Hodor helps Bran onto his horse.

                   You didn’t give me an honest answer.

                   That's not the same as being a liar.

                   In the Godswood, you told me you didn’t

                   I dreamt that the sea came to 
                   Winterfell.  I saw waves crashing into 
                   the gates, and the water came flowing 
                   over the walls. 
                    
           Bran looks around at the castle walls and his people.

                   Flooded the castle.  Drowned men were 
                   floating here, in the yard.  Ser Rodrik 
                   was one of them.

                   Are you saying we should fall back to

                   of doing things.  They'll hit us in 
                   force, and they won't run away when we 
                   hit back.  They're gonna be more 
                   organized than before, more disciplined, 
                   more like us.

                   things their way.  Sneak in, kill Mance, 
                   and scatter them to the winds before 
                   they can march on the Wall.  And to do

                   Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord 
                   Qhorin. 
                    
                          QHORIN 
                   I've been called lots of things, but 
                   that might be my first Lord Qhorin. 
                    
                          MORMONT 
                   You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger. 
                    
                          JON 
                   I've fought and killed a wight.  How 
                   many rangers can say that? 
                    
                          QHORIN 
                   He's the one? 
                    
                          MORMONT 
                   Aye, you killed a wight.  You also let 
                   an old man beat you bloody and take your 
                   sword. 
                    
           A few rangers chuckle. 
            
                          QHORIN 
                   Craster?  In the boy's defense, that's a 
                   tough old goat. 
                    
           Samwell steps forward.

                   I could take up Jon's duties while he's 
                   gone, My Lord.  It would be no trouble.

           INT. QARTH - PALACE OF XARO - NIGHT. 
            
           Xaro and Dany stroll and talk as people mingle around them. 
            
                          XARO 
                   So tell me, how long as your manservant 
                   been in love with you? 
                    
                          DANY 
                   (LAUGH)  He's not my manservant and he's 
                   not in love with me.  He's my advisor.  
                   My friend. 
                    
                          XARO 
                   Unlikely.  I can almost always tell what 
                   a man wants. 
                    
                          DANY 
                   And what about what a woman wants? 
                    
                          XARO 
                   Much more complicated.  You, for 
                   example, what do you want? 
                    
                          DANY 
                   To cross the Narrow Sea and take back 
                   the Iron Throne. 
                    
                          XARO 
                   Why? 
                    
                          DANY 
                   Because I promised my Khalasar I'd 
                   protect them and find them a safe home.

                   (LAUGH)  You want to conquer the Seven 
                   Kingdoms for the Dothraki. 
                    
                          DANY 
                   I want them because they're mine by 
                   right.  The Iron Throne is mine and I 
                   will take it. 
                    
                          XARO 
                   Ah, a conqueror. 
                    
                          DANY 
                   And how did you get all of this?  Did 
                   someone give it to you? 
                    
                          XARO 
                   No.  I come from nothing.  I hit the 
                   docks like a piece of cargo, expect 
                   someone normally cares what happens to 
                   cargo. 
                    
                          DANY 
                   So you wanted more than you had and you 
                   took it.  You're a conqueror, too.  
                   You're just less ambitious. 
                    
                          XARO 
                   (LAUGH)  Mm.

                   What do you want, Xaro Xhaon Daxos?  The

                   Why? 
                    
                          XARO 
                   I will show you why. 
                    
           Xaro takes Dany's hand and leads her away.

           Xaro and Dany stand outside the vault.  Xaro strikes the 
           vault with his sword to demonstrate its strength.

                   birthright.

                          JORAH 
                   But you have something more than that.  
                   You may cover it up and deny it, but you 
                   have a gentle heart.  You would not only 
                   be respected and feared, you would be 
                   loved.  Someone who can rule and should 
                   rule.  Centuries come and go without a 
                   person like that coming into the world.  
                   There are times when I look at you and I 
                   still can't believe you're real. 
                    
           Dany and Jorah stand in silence for a long moment.

                   So what would you have me do as my

                   Make your own way.  Find your own ship.  
                   You only need one.  The allies we need 
                   are in Westeros, not Qarth. 
                    
                          DANY 
                   And how do I get this ship? 
                    
                          JORAH 
                   I'll find it for you.  A sound ship with 
                   a good captain. 
                    
           Dany turns to face Jorah. 
            
                          DANY 
                   I look forward to meeting him. 
                    
           Jorah bows in front of Dany before walking away.

           Dany checks on her dragons. 
            
            
           EXT. HARRENHAL - FORGES - DAY. 
            
           Gendry places a fresh-forged sword in a tub of cold water.  
           Arya sits close by and nibbles on bread.  Gendry swings the 
           sword in practice.

                          ARYA 
                   You should stand sideface. 
                    
                          GENDRY 
                   Sideface? 
                    
                          ARYA 
                   Sideways. 
                    
                          GENDRY 
                   Why?

               Gendry looks around. 
                
                                  GENDRY 
                         Am I fighting someone? 
                          
                                  ARYA 
                         You're practicing for a fight.  You 
                         should practice right. 
                          
               Arya shoves a piece of bread into her mouth.   
                
                                  WOMAN (OS)

        [MUSIC IN] 
         
               Arya and Gendry turn when they hear a loud scream.  Gendry 
               and  Arya run to find the Tickler lying on the ground with a 
               broken neck, surrounded by others.   
                
                                  MAN 
                         Did you see anything?  Go up there! 
                
               Among the commotion, Arya looks up and around until she 
               spots Jaqen looking back at her.  He holds up one finger and 
               nonchalantly points it toward his eye as if to say, 'one 
               down.'   
                                   
               Fade to black.
