                   Welcome Lord Stark. Grand Maester
                   Pycelle has called a meeting of the small
                   council. The honor of your presence is
                   requested.

                        I have a knack for it. Must be strange
                        for you, coming into this room. I'm
                        standing right here when it happened. It
                        was very brave of your brother, your
                        father, too.  They didn't deserve to die
                        like that. Nobody deserves to die like

                        Five hundred men just stood there and
                        watched. All the great knights of the
                        Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a
                        word? Lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark.
                        Five hundred men, and this room was
                        silent as a crypt except for the screams,
                        of course and the Mad King laughing. And
                        later, when I watched the Mad King die, I
                        remembered him laughing as your father
                        burned…  It felt like justice.

                        I've hoped to meet you for some time,

                           JOFFREY
                   I'm not like him.I didn't fight off
                   anything. It bit me, and all I did was
                   scream.And the two Stark girls saw it,
                   both of them.

                   That's not true. You killed the beast.
                   You only spared the girl because of the
                   love your father bears her father.

                   Yes. She's very beautiful and young, and
                   if you don't like her, you only need to
                   see her on formal occasions. And when
                   the time comes to make little princes and
                   princesses.

                        We allow the Northerners too much power.
                        They consider themselves our equals.

                        I'd double their taxes. And command them

                        Why should every lord command his own
                        men? It's primitive. No better than the
                        hill tribes.  We should have a-a standing
                        army of men loyal to the crown. Trained
                        by experienced solders instead of a mob

                   The North cannot be held. Not by an
                   outsider. It's too big and too wild.
                   And when the winter comes, the seven Gods

                   Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you
                   know about fear? Fear is for the winter,
                   when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.
                   Fear is for the long night, when the sun
                   hides for years and children are born and
                   live and die all in darkness. That is
                   the time for fear, my little lord, when
                   the White Walkers move through the woods.
                   Thousands of years ago, there came a
                   night that lasted a generation. Kings
                   froze to death in their castles, same as
                   the shepherds in their huts, and women
                   smothered their babies rather than see
                   them starve, and wept, and felt the tears

                   In that darkness, the White Walkers came
                   for the first time. They swept through
                   cities and kingdoms, riding their dead
                   horses, hunting with their packs of pale
                   spiders big as hounds.

                        Summerhall. My horse took an arrow, so I
                        was on foot slumming through the mud. He
                        came running at me, this dumb high boned
                        lad, thinking he could end the rebellion
                        with a single swing of his sword. I
                        knocked him down with a hammer. Gods, I
                        was strong then. Caved in his
                        breastplate.  Probably shattered every
                        rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in
                        the air, right before I brought it down,
                        he shouted: Wait! Wait! [LAUGH] They
                        never tell you how they all shit
                        themselves. They don’t put that part in
                        the songs. Stupid boy. Now, the Tarly's
                        bend the knee like everyone else. He
                        could have lingered on the edge of the
                        battle with the smart boys, and today,
                        his wife would be making him miserable,
                        his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be

                        Mad King say when you stabbed him in the
                        back? I never asked. Did he call you a
                        traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?

                   Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?
                           JORAH
                   The Dothraki don't believe in money.
                   Most of their slaves were given to them
                   as gifts.

                   If you rule a city and you see the horde
                   approaching, you have two choices: Pay
                   tribute or fight.An easy choice for
                   most. Of course, sometimes it's not
                   enough.Sometimes a khal feels insulted
                   by the number of slaves he's given. He
                   might think the men are too week, or the
                   women too ugly. Sometimes a khal decides
                   his riders haven't had a good fight in
                   months and need the practice.
                           DANY
                   Tell them all to stop.
                           JORAH
                   You want the entire horde to stop? For
                   how long?

                   You don't have enough men to be an army.
                   And aside from Yoren here, none of you
                   are particularly funny.
                           BENJEN
                   I hope we provided you with some good
                   stories to tell when you're back in
                   King's Landing. But something to think
                   about when you're drinking your wine down
                   there, enjoying your brothels. Half the
                   boys you've seen training will die north
                   of the Wall.Might be a wildling's axe
                   that gets them. Might be sickness.
                   Might just be the cold. They die in pain
                   and they do it so plump little lords like
                   you can enjoy your summer afternoons in
                   peace and comfort.
                           TYRION
                   Do you think I'm plump?
                           TYRION
                   Listen Benjen. May I call you Benjen?
                           BENJEN
                   Call me what you like.
                           TYRION
                   I’m not sure what I've done to offend
                   you. I have great admiration for the
                   Night's Watch. I've great admiration for
                   you, as First Ranger.
                           BENJEN
                   You know, my brother once told me that
                   nothing someone says before the word
                   "but" really counts.
                           TYRION
                   But. I don't believe that giants and
                   ghouls and White Walkers are lurking
                   beyond the wall. I believe that the only
                   difference between us and the wildlings
                   is that when that Wall went up, our
                   ancestors happened to live on the right
                   side of it.

                                    BENJEN
                         The wildlings are no different from us.
                         A little rougher maybe. But they're made
                         of meat and bone. I know how to track
                         'em and I know how to kill 'em. It's not
                         the Wall that's given me sleepless
                         nights. You've never been north of the
                         Wall, so don't me what's out there.

                        Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit
                        a moving target. Except for you. You
                        move too much. I could just hold my
                        sword out and let you do the work for me.

                         Awe, they say that the winter of my birth
                         was three years long, Maester Aemon
                                    AEMON
                         This summer has lasted nine. But reports
                         from the Citadel tell us the days grow
                         shorter. Starks are always right,
                         eventually. Winter is coming. This one
                         will be long, and dark things will come
                         with it.

                         We've been capturing wildlings. More
                         every month. They're fleeing south. The
                         ones who flee say they've seen the White
                         Walkers.

                         they see mermaids.

                         One of our own rangers swore they saw
                         them kill his companions. He swore it
                         right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped
                         his head off.

                         beyond. And it has become an army of
                         undisciplined boys and tired old men.
                         There are less than a thousand of us now.
                         We can't man the other castles on the

                        It is heavy as it needs to be to make you
                        strong.  Just so. One hand is all that
                        is needed. Now you're standing all
                        wrong. Turn your body sideface. Yes.
                        So you are skinny. That is good. The
                        target is smaller. Now the grip. Let me

                        Yes. The grip must be delicate.
                                    ARYA
                        What if I drop it?

                        The steel must be part of your arm. Can
                        you drop part of your arm? No. Nine

                        all. [CLICKS TEETH] That is the grip.
                        You are not holding a battle axe. You

                        Ah. [LAUGH] Just so. Now, we will begin
                        the dance. Remember child, this is not
                        the dance of the Westeros we are
                        learning. The knight's dance. Hacking
                        and hammering. This is the bravo's
                        dance. The water dance. It is swift and
                        sudden.  All men are made of water. Do
                        you know this? If you pierce 'em, the
                        water leaks out, and they die. Now you
