           Bran is running along the woods.  He then stops and looks 
           around.

                   (panting) 
           Bran turns around and walks back.  A raven suddenly flies 
           in front of him.

           The raven lands on a branch of a tree. It turns to look at 
           him. It has three eyes.  Bran moves closer to the raven, 
           pulls an arrow and aims at the raven.

           Jon Snow and Robb are standing beside Bran.

                   Relax your bow arm. 
           Bran fires the arrow at the raven.  Bran misses the raven 
           and it flies away.

           Bran sits upright as he wakes up from his dream.

           Summer and Shaggydog looks at him.  Rickon sits up and 
           looks at Bran.  Hodor walks towards Bran's tent.

                   Will I be wearing manacles when I lay 
                   my father to rest?  Something else?

                          ROBB 
                   By the time Bolton's bastard got to 
                   Winterfell, the ironborn were gone. 
                          ROBB (CONT'D - OS) 
                   They massacred everyone and put the 
                   castle to the torch. 
                          ROBB (CONT'D) 
                   And Bran and Rickon have not been 
                   found. 
                          ROBB (CONT'D - OS) 
                   They may have escaped. 
                          ROBB (CONT'D) 
                   Or Theon may have taken them back to 
                   the... 
                          ROBB (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...Iron Islands as hostages.

                          CATELYN 
                   Have you received any demands? 
      01:06:24 
                          ROBB 
                   (sighs) No. 
      01:06:26 
                          CATELYN (OS) 
                   Have you... 
           Catelyn stands up.

                   ...heard anything from Theon at all? 
           INT. CASTLE - DUNGEON - NIGHT. 
            
           Theon is inside the dungeon.  A guard takes the hood off of 
           his head while another guard throws a pail of water from 
           behind. 
            
      01:06:33 
                          THEON 
                   (gasps) 
      [MUSIC IN] 
            
           Lord Torturer walks towards Theon. 
                          THEON (CONT'D - OS) 
                   (shivering) 
                          THEON (CONT'D) 
                   Where am I? 
           Lord Torturer pulls out his dagger. 
                          THEON (CONT'D) 
                   Who are you? 
           Lord Torturer moves closer to Theon and holds his middle 
           finger. 
                          THEON (CONT'D) 
                   What do you want? 
      01:07:08 
                          LORD TORTURER 
                   I want to do this. 
           Lord Torturer cuts Theon's middle finger. 
            
      01:07:10

           Jaime walks out of the bushes with his hands in chains.  
           Brienne follows behind holding the rope tied to the chain 
           on Jamie's hands. 
            
      01:07:16 
                          JAIME 
                   Do you know how long it's going to take 
                   us to get to King's Landing walking 
                   through fields and forests? 
      01:07:20 
                          BRIENNE 
                   Yes. 
      01:07:21 
                          SHEEP (OS) 
                   (bleating) 
           Jaime and Brienne walk along the field. 
            
      01:07:23 
                          JAIME 
                   So how shall we pass the time? 
      01:07:24 
                          BRIENNE 
                   By putting one foot in front of the 
                   other. 
      01:07:27 
                          JAIME 
                   It's going to be a very dull walk. 
      01:07:29 
                          BRIENNE 
                   I'm here to take you to King's Landing 
                   and bring back Lady Stark's daughters 
                   in exchange.  Dull is fine. 
                             10                       3/14/2012

      01:07:35 
                          JAIME 
                   You know... 
           Jaime stops and turns to Brienne. 
                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   ...it doesn't matter how loyal a 
                   servant... 
           Brienne pushes Jaime forward. 
                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   ...you are, no one enjoys the company 
                   of a humorless mute.  Trust me on this.  
                   People have been serving me since I was 
                   born.  You think Lady Stark is going to 
                   want a giant towheaded plank following 
                   her around for the rest of her life? 
           Brienne pushes Jamie again. 
                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   A week's journey with you and she'll 
                   order you to fall on your sword. 
      01:07:54 
                          BRIENNE 
                   If Lady Stark is unhappy with any 
                   aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll 
                   let me know.  She's an honest woman. 
           Jaime and Brienne enter the forest. 
            
      01:08:01 
                          JAIME 
                   All the good it's done her. 
           EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS. 
            
           Brienne stands near Jaime who is peeing at a tree.

                   (moans) How did you come into Lady       
                   Stark's service?  There's something we 
                   can talk about. 
      01:08:13 
                          BRIENNE 
                   Not your concern, Kingslayer. 
      01:08:15 
                          JAIME 
                   It had to be recently.  You weren't 
                   with her at Winterfell. 
      01:08:19 
                          BRIENNE 
                   How would you know? 
           Jaime turns to Brienne. 
            
      01:08:21 
                          JAIME 
                   Because I visited Winterfell.  I would 
                   have noticed your dour head smacking 
                   into the archways. 
           Brienne pulls the rope tied to Jamie's chains. 
            
      01:08:28 
                          BRIENNE 
                   Move. 
           Jaime and Brienne continue walking along the forest. 
            
      01:08:34 
                          JAIME 
                   Were you pledged to Stannis? 
      01:08:36 
                          BRIENNE 
                   Gods, no.

      01:08:37 
                          JAIME 
                   Ah, Renly.  Really?  He wasn't fit to 
                   rule over anything more important than 
                   a 12-course meal. 
      01:08:44 
                          BRIENNE 
                   Shut your mouth. 
      01:08:45 
                          JAIME 
                   Why?  I lived with him at court since 
                   he was a boy, don't forget.  Could 
                   hardly escape the little tulip.  
                   Skipping down the corridors in his 
                   embroidered silks.  I knew him far 
                   better than you. 
      01:08:55 
                          BRIENNE 
                   I knew him as well as anyone.  As a 
                   member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me 
                   with everything.  He would have been a 
                   wonderful king. 
      01:09:02 
                          JAIME 
                   Sounds like you quite fancied him. 
      01:09:04 
                          BRIENNE 
                   I did not fancy him. 
      01:09:07 
                          JAIME 
                   Oh, gods, you did.

                   Did you ever tell him?                   
                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   No, of course not.  You weren't Renly's 
                   type, I'm afraid. 
           Brienne pushes Jaime forward. 
                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   He preferred curly-haired little girls 
                   like Loras Tyrell.  You're far too much 
                   man for him. 
      01:09:22 
                          BRIENNE 
                   I'm not interested in foul rumors. 
      01:09:24 
                          JAIME 
                   Unless they're about me.  It's all true 
                   about Renly.  His proclivities were the 
                   worst kept secret at court.  It's a 
                   shame the throne isn't made out of 
                   cocks.  They'd have never got him off 
                   it. 
           Brienne grabs Jaime's hair and pulls him closer to her.

                          BRIENNE 
                   Shut your mouth! 
      01:09:38 
                          JAIME 
                   I don't blame him.  And I don't blame 
                   you, either.  We don't get to choose 
                   who we love.

                   (snorts) 
           Brienne lets go of Jaime's hair as they see an old man 
           walking with his horse.  The old man stops and looks at 
           them. 
            
      01:09:57 
                          OLD MAN 
                   Where are you headed, then? 
      01:09:58 
                          JAIME 
                   South.  You? 
      01:10:00 
                          OLD MAN 
                   Riverrun.  Staying off the Kingsroad, 
                   are you?  They get you no matter where 
                   you go.  You can't win. 
      01:10:07 
                          JAIME 
                   No, you really can't. 
      01:10:09 
                          OLD MAN 
                   Looks like you're safe enough, though.  
                   Meaning no offense, my lady, but...  
                   (laughs) I wouldn't tangle with you.

           The old man continues moving along with his horse.

                          JAIME (OS) 
                   He knows who I am. 
           Jaime and Brienne observe the man as he walks away. 
            
      01:10:28 
                          BRIENNE 
                   He doesn't. 
      01:10:28 
                          JAIME 
                   Maybe you're right.  But what if you're 
                   not? 
                          JAIME (CONT'D - OS) 
                   What if he tells someone? 
      01:10:35 
                          BRIENNE 
                   We're not doing it. 
                          BRIENNE (CONT'D - OS) 
                   He's an innocent man. 
      01:10:39

                   More innocent...

                   ...than Lady Stark's daughters? 
           Brienne pushes Jaime to move forward.  Jaime and Brienne 
           continue walking.

           Joffrey looks at himself in front of a mirror as he tries 
           on his new robe.  A tailor stands beside him. 
            
      01:10:53 
                          JOFFREY 
                   Make it tighter here. 
           Cersei sits on the chair near by, watching Joffrey. 
            
      01:10:57 
                          CERSEI 
                   That's better. 
           The tailor puts a scarf on Joffrey's shoulder. 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D - OS) 
                   It makes you look very strong. 
      01:11:01 
                          JOFFREY 
                   No flowers. 
           Joffrey takes the scarf from his shoulders and looks at the 
           tailor. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   I said no flowers. 
           Joffrey points towards the scarves hanging on the garment 
           rack. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   All these are wrong.  Bring others.

                   Yes, Your Grace. 
           The tailor walks away.

                   Bloody flowers.  On the king.

                          CERSEI 
                   Looks like a Tyrell rose.  Give it to 
                   Margaery for her wedding gown.  Should 
                   be more than enough fabric. 
           Joffrey throws the scarf and walks towards his bed. 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   Tell me what you think of her. 
           Joffrey takes off his robe. 
            
      01:11:31 
                          JOFFREY 
                   Who? 
      01:11:32 
                          CERSEI 
                   Margaery.

                   ...Northerners.  Hang their lords, burn 
                   their strongholds... 
           Joffrey puts on his clothes. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   ...sow their fields with salt, and no

                          CERSEI 
                   It is a good match, but what do you 
                   think of her?  She's beautiful and 
                   intelligent. 
      01:11:59 
                          JOFFREY 
                   (chuckles) Yes, she is.

                          CERSEI (OS)

                   Not to me.

                          CERSEI 
                   (chuckles) I only meant that to go out

                   This is becoming one of the most boring 
                   conversations I've ever had. 
           Cersei looks at Joffrey, stands up and walks closer to him.

                   Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins  
                   for a reason.  She dresses like a 
                   harlot for a reason.  She married a 
                   traitor and known degenerate like Renly 
                   Baratheon for a reason. 
      01:12:30 
                          JOFFREY 
                   She married Renly Baratheon because she 
                   was told to.  That's what intelligent 
                   women do--what they're told.

                          JOFFREY 
                   I don't need to do anything. 
           Joffrey walks back to the mirror and gets up on a stool.  
           The tailor puts the scarf on Joffrey's shoulder. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   (sighs) Better.  Much better. 
           INT. KING'S LANDING - SANSA'S ROOM - DAY. 
            
           Sansa sits on the chair and looks at her self in the

                   He didn't.  He didn't want anything.     
                   He just takes an interest because he 
                   loved my mother.

                   we met.  At the Hand's tourney, you 
                   gave me your favor.  A rose, a red 
                   rose. 
      01:14:53 
                          LORAS 
                   Of course I did. 
      01:14:56 
                          MARGAERY (OS) 
                   (chuckles) It's more your color.  You 
                   take it. 
           Margaery turns to Sansa and Loras.

                          WOMAN (OS) 
                   Thank you. 
           Margaery approaches them. 
            
      01:15:02 
                          MARGAERY 
                   You're such a dear. 
      01:15:03 
                          LORAS 
                   I'll take my leave.  Lady Sansa. 
           Loras walks away, leaving Sansa and Loras. 
            
      01:15:07 
                          SANSA 
                   Thank you, Ser Loras. 
      01:15:10 
                          MARGAERY 
                   Come. 
           Margaery and Sansa walk towards Lady Olenna who is sitting 
           at the center of the garden. 
            
      01:15:17 
                          MARGAERY 
                   Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present 
                   my grandmother...the Lady Olenna of 
                   House Tyrell. 
           Olenna extends her hand for Sansa. 
            
      01:15:26 
                          OLENNA 
                   Kiss me, child. 
           Sansa holds Ollena's hand and kisses it. 
            
                             24                       3/14/2012

                          OLENNA (CONT'D)                   
                   It's so good of you to visit me and my 
                   foolish flock of hens.  We're very 
                   sorry for your losses. 
      01:15:34 
                          SANSA 
                   And I was sorry when I heard of Lord 
                   Renly's death, Lady Margaery.  He was 
                   very gallant. 
      01:15:39 
                          OLENNA 
                   Gallant, yes.  And charming and very 
                   clean.  He knew how to dress and smile 
                   and somehow this gave him the notion he 
                   was fit to be king. 
      01:15:47 
                          MARGAERY (OS) 
                   Renly was brave and gentle... 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   ...Grandmother.  Father liked him and 
                   so did Loras. 
      01:15:51 
                          OLENNA 
                   Loras is young and very good at 
                   knocking men off horses with a stick.  
                   That does not make him wise.  As to 
                   your fathead father... 
      01:15:59 
                          MARGAERY 
                   Grandmother!  What will Sansa think of 
                   us? 
      01:16:01 
                          OLENNA (OS) 
                   She might think we have some wits about 
                             25                       3/14/2012

                                                    EPISODE #302 
                   us.  One of us...                        
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   ...at any rate.  It was treason.  I 
                   warned them.  Robert has two sons and 
                   Renly has an older brother.  How could 
                   he possibly have any claim to that ugly 
                   iron chair?  We should have stayed well 
                   out of all this if you ask me.  But 
                   once the cow's been milked, there's no 
                   squirting the cream back up her udders.  
                   So here we are to see things through.  
                   What do you say to that, Sansa?  Shall 
                   we have some lemon cakes? 
      01:16:32 
                          SANSA 
                   Lemon cake's my favorite. 
      01:16:33 
                          OLENNA 
                   So we've been told. 
           Olenna faces the servant. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   Are you going to bring the food or do 
                   you mean to starve us to death? 
           The servant nods.  Olenna stands up and gestures Sansa to 
           follow her. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   Here, Sansa, come sit with me. 
           Olenna walks to the gazebo.  The servant serves the food at 
           the table. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   I'm much less boring than these others. 
           Olenna, Sansa and Margaery walk to a table at the gazebo. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   Do you know my son? 
                             26                       3/14/2012

           The girls sit at a table. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   The Lord of Highgarden? 
      01:16:54 
                          SANSA 
                   I haven't had the pleasure. 
      01:16:56 
                          OLENNA 
                   No great pleasure, believe me.  A 
                   ponderous oaf. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   His father was an oaf as well.  My 
                   husband, the late Lord Luthor. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   He managed to ride off a cliff whilst 
                   hawking.  They say he was looking up at 
                   the sky and paying no mind to where his 
                   horse was taking him.  And now my son 
                   is doing the same, only this time he's 
                   riding a lion instead of a horse.  And 
                   now, I want you to tell me the truth 
                   about this royal boy, this Joffrey. 
      01:17:28 
                          SANSA 
                   I...I... 
      01:17:30 
                          OLENNA 
                   You, you.  Who else would know better?  
                   We've heard some troubling tales.  Is 
                   there any truth to them? 
           Margaery looks at Sansa. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Has this boy mistreated you? 
                             27                       3/14/2012

                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   Has he ripped out your tongue? 
      01:17:44 
                          SANSA 
                   Joff--King Joffrey, he-His Grace is 
                   very fair and handsome and as brave as 
                   a lion. 
      01:17:52 
                          OLENNA (OS) 
                   Yes, all Lannisters are... 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   ...lions.  And when a Tyrell farts, it 
                   smells like a rose. 
           Sansa looks down. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   But how kind is he?  How clever? 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   Has he a good heart, a gentle hand? 
      01:18:03 
                          MARGAERY 
                   I'm to be his wife.  I only want to 
                   know what that means. 
           Sansa looks behind her.  A servant walks to their table, 
           serving a plate of lemon cakes. 
            
      01:18:15 
                          OLENNA 
                   Bring me some cheese. 
           Olenna takes the plate of lemon cake.

                   The cheese will be served after the      
                   cakes, my lady. 
      01:18:19 
                          OLENNA 
                   The cheese will be served when I want 
                   it served.  And I want it served now. 
           The servant nods his head and walks away.  Sansa looks at 
           the servant as he leaves.  Olenna offers the lemon cakes to 
           Sansa. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   Are you frightened, child? 
           Sansa takes a lemon cake and pouts it on her plate. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   No need for that.  We're only women 
                   here.  Tell us the truth.  No harm will 
                   come to you. 
           Olenna passes the plate of lemon cakes to Margaery. 
            
      01:18:38 
                          SANSA 
                   My father always told the truth. 
      01:18:40 
                          OLENNA (OS) 
                   Yes... 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   ...he had that reputation.  And they 
                   named him traitor... 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...and took his head.

                   Joffrey.

                          SANSA (CONT'D) 
                   Joffrey did that.  He promised he would 
                   be merciful and he cut my father's head 
                   off.  And he said that was mercy.  Then 
                   he took me up on the walls and made me 
                   look at it. 
      01:19:03 
                          MARGAERY 
                   Go on. 
      01:19:06 
                          SANSA 
                   I-I can't.  I never meant--my father 
                   was a traitor.  My brother as well.  I 
                   have traitor's blood.  Please don't 
                   make me say anymore. 
      01:19:16 
                          MARGAERY 
                   She's terrified, Grandmother.  Just 
                   look at her. 
      01:19:19 
                          OLENNA 
                   Speak freely, child.  We would never 
                   betray your confidence, I swear it. 
      01:19:27 
                          SANSA 
                   He's a monster. 
      01:19:31 
                          OLENNA 
                   Ah.

           Lord Rickard Karstark and Robb are at the side of the road,

                          KARSTARK 
                   If it's revenge, I still got faith in 
                   it.

                          ROBB

                   I think you lost this war the day you

                          TALISA 
                   Whoa, whoa. 
           Talisa stops her near where Catelyn.  A soldier walks 
           towards Talisa.

           Talisa gets off her horse. 
                          CATELYN (CONT'D) 
                   And she knows it.

                   I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...

                          CATELYN 
                   You can't help because a mother makes 
                   one for her children to protect them. 
           Catelyn stops working and looks at Talisa. 
                          CATELYN (CONT'D) 
                   Only a mother can make them. 
           Catelyn continues to working.

                   Many years before that, one of the boys 
                   came down with the pox.  Maester Luwin 
                   said if he made it through the night, 
                   he'd live.  But it would be a very long 
                   night.  So I sat with him all through 
                   the darkness.  Listened to his ragged 
                   little breaths, his coughing, his 
                   whimpering.

                          CATELYN 
                   Jon Snow.  When my husband brought that 
                   baby home from the war, I couldn't bear 
                   to look at him.  I didn't want to see 
                   those brown... 
                          CATELYN (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...stranger's eyes staring up at me.  
                   So I prayed to the gods, take him away.  
                   Make him... 
                          CATELYN (CONT'D) 
                   ...die.  He got the pox. 
                          CATELYN (CONT'D - OS) 
                   And I knew I was the worst woman who 
                   ever lived. 
                          CATELYN (CONT'D) 
                   A murderer.  I'd condemned this poor, 
                   innocent child to a horrible death all

                   because I was jealous of his mother.  A  
                   woman he didn't even know.  So I prayed 
                   to all seven gods, let the boy live.  
                   Let him live and I'll love him.  I'll 
                   be a mother to him.  I'll beg my 
                   husband to give him a true name, to 
                   call him Stark and be done with it, to 
                   make him one of us.

                          CATELYN 
                   And he lived.  And I couldn't keep my 
                   promise. 
                          CATELYN (CONT'D - OS) 
                   And everything that's happened since

                          CATELYN (CONT'D) 
                   ...it's all because I couldn't love a

                   Do you know what it takes to unite 90 
                   clans, half of whom want to massacre 
                   the other half for one insult or 
                   another?  They speak seven different 
                   languages in my army.

                   know how I got moon worshippers and 
                   cannibals and giants to march together 
                   in the same army?

           Orell is sitting on a rock looking at the sky while Tormund

           Samwell wipes his tears.

                   There's 200 brothers killed by dead men 
                   and you're still here whimpering.  That

                   you lie down and rest for a while, eh?  
                   You know you want to. 
           Rast walks away.  Samwell goes down on one knee.  Rast 
           looks back at Samwell then continues walking.  Grenn looks 
           back and sees Samwell.  He then calls Eddison.

                          THOROS (OS) 
                   The Brotherhood Without Banners. 
           Thoros moves closer to Arya. 
                          THOROS (CONT'D) 
                   Now come along.  I want to hear how two 
                   boys and a very dangerous girl escaped 
                   Harrenhal. 
      01:35:00 
                          HOT PIE (OS) 
                   I'm not going with them. 
                          HOT PIE (CONT'D) 
                   The Brotherhood?  That's who the 
                   Mountain and them lot were looking for.  
                   They'll bring us back and put rats in 
                   us. 
      01:35:08 
                          THOROS 
                   You've got nothing to fear from us, 
                   son.  The lords of Westeros want to 
                   burn the countryside.  We're trying to 
                   save it.  Now come on.  We'll talk some 
                   more over brown bread and stew.  And 
                   then you can go on your way. 
           Hot Pie steps back.  Thoros looks back at Anguy. 
            
      [MUSIC IN] 
            
           Anguy pulls out an arrow. 
                          ANGUY 
                   Here's the thing, fat boy. 
           Anguy aims the arrow to the sky and fires.

                          ANGUY (CONT'D)                    
                   When I'm done talking, that arrow's 
                   falling down on your... 
           Hot pie looks for the arrow in the sky. 
                          ANGUY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...fat head.  So I advise you move... 
                          ANGUY (CONT'D) 
                   ...because I'm done talking. 
           Hot Pie moves from his place.  The arrow hits the ground 
           exactly where Hot Pie was standing before he moved.

                          MEN 
                   (laughing) 
           Arya, Gendry, Hot Pie and the Brotherhood Without Banners 
           start moving.  Anguy and Thoros look at Hot Pie who is 
           struggling to get through the hole in wall. 
            
      01:35:57 
                          ANGUY 
                   Half the country's starving and look at 
                   this one. 
      01:36:01 
                          THOROS 
                   Maybe he's the reason half the 
                   country's starving. 
           Thoros walks away.  Anguy pulls his arrow from a tree. 
            
           INT. RED KEEP - TYRION'S ROOM - DAY. 
            
           Tyrion enters his room and puts his dagger on the table.  
           Shae is lying on his bed.

           Tyrion looks towards Shae who is lying on his bed and 
           approaches her. 
            
      01:36:15 
                          TYRION 
                   We've spoken of this. 
           Shae sits up on the bed. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   You cannot come here. 
           Tyrion kisses Shae. 
            
      01:36:24 
                          SHAE 
                   But you said I should come to you with 
                   any problems. 
      01:36:27 
                          TYRION 
                   Did anyone see you? 
      01:36:29 
                          SHAE 
                   No. 
      01:36:30 
                          TYRION 
                   You sure?  My father does not make idle 
                   threats.  Having you killed would be 
                   the high point of his week.  You have 
                   to be absolutely certain. 
           Shae kisses Tyrion. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   All right.  What is this problem?

                   I'm worried about Sansa.  When she 
                   spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend 
                   warned me about him. 
      01:36:56 
                          TYRION 
                   Baelish doesn't have friends. 
      01:36:59 
                          SHAE 
                   I don't know her name. 
      01:37:01 
                          TYRION 
                   Oh, Ros?  The redhead? 
      01:37:03 
                          SHAE 
                   How do you know her? 
      01:37:04 
                          TYRION 
                   I try to know as many people as I can.  
                   You never know which one you'll need. 
      01:37:08 
                          SHAE 
                   She's a whore. 
      01:37:10 
                          TYRION 
                   Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental 
                   about these things. 
      01:37:13 
                          SHAE 
                   You fucked her. 
                             57                       3/14/2012

                   Oh, please.  All right, yes, I fucked 
                   her once.  Twice. 
           Shae pushes Tyrion away and walks towards the window. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   But since I met you, my lady... 
           Shae sits at the window.  Tyrion moves closer to her. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   ...I've been with no one else. 
      01:37:31 
                          SHAE 
                   And was she good?  Did you like her? 
      01:37:34 
                          TYRION 
                   Not as much as I like you, obviously, 
                   or she'd be the one torturing me right 
                   now. 
           Tyrion tries to kiss Shae but she pushes him away.  Tyrion 
           adjusts Shae's dress. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   What did she say about Littlefinger? 
      01:37:47 
                          SHAE 
                   That Sansa shouldn't trust him. 
      01:37:50 
                          TYRION 
                   Is there an idiot in any village who 
                   trusts Littlefinger? 
           Shae touches Tyrion's clothes.

                   We have to protect her. 
      01:37:58 
                          TYRION 
                   We can't.  Now that the Lannisters have 
                   discarded her, Sansa will have many 
                   suitors.  A great beauty with a very 
                   old name. 
      01:38:08 
                          SHAE 
                   A great beauty? 
           Shae pushes Tyrion. 
                          SHAE (CONT'D) 
                   Oh, a great beauty? 
      01:38:11 
                          TYRION 
                   Yes, she is... 
           Shae stands up with her hands on her hips. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   ...objectively, very.  Her face is 
                   quite pleasing--to other men and to 
                   women, people in general.  But not to 
                   me, of course.  I only have eyes for 
                   you. 
           Tyrion attempts to touches Shae but she shoves his hands 
           away. 
            
      01:38:26 
                          SHAE 
                   You pervert.  You want her?  This 
                   child? 
           Tyrion walk towards his bed.

                   I don't even want to talk about her.

                          SHAE 
                   But you are.

           Shae moves closer to Tyrion and holds him by the chin. 
                          SHAE (CONT'D) 
                   I didn't force you to open your mouth 
                   and make words come out. 
      01:38:39 
                          TYRION 
                   This is cruel and unfair.  Cruelly 
                   unfair.

                          SHAE

      01:39:04 
                          TYRION 
                   Only if you stop.  But you mustn't come

                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   ...full of dangerous people.

                   Send her in.                             
            
           The guard opens the door for Margaery.  Margaery enters the 
           room.  The guard closes the door. 
            
      01:39:55 
                          MARGAERY 
                   You wanted to see me, Your Grace? 
      01:39:57 
                          JOFFREY 
                   I'm leaving on a hunting trip.  I just 
                   wanted to make sure you had everything 
                   you need before I left. 
      01:40:03 
                          MARGAERY 
                   That's very thoughtful, Your Grace.  I 
                   have everything I could want. 
      01:40:07 
                          JOFFREY 
                   Good.  Good.  How are you finding life 
                   in the capital?  It must be quite a 
                   change after Renly's camp. 
           Margaery moves closer to Joffrey. 
            
      01:40:14 
                          MARGAERY 
                   A welcome one.  A military encampment 
                   is no place for a lady. 
      01:40:21 
                          JOFFREY 
                   And the bedside of a traitor?

                   Is that a place for a lady? 
      01:40:29 
                          MARGAERY 
                   Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a 
                   wife... 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...that is all. 
      01:40:35 
                          JOFFREY 
                   What was your duty to this traitor as 
                   you saw it? 
      01:40:39 
                          MARGAERY 
                   The duty of any wife to any husband--to 
                   provide him with children. 
      01:40:43 
                          JOFFREY (OS) 
                   You failed to do this. 
                   Why?   JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
            
      01:40:46 
                          MARGAERY (OS) 
                   I... 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   I would not speak ill of the dead, Your 
                   Grace. 
      01:40:52 
                          JOFFREY 
                   You think one ought to speak kindly of 
                   a traitor merely because he's had a 
                   sword put through his heart?

                          MARGAERY 
                   No.  I do beg your pardon.  The 
                   subtleties of politics are often lost 
                   on me.  Renly...I don't believe he... 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...was interested in the company of 
                   women. 
      01:41:17 
                          JOFFREY 
                   What makes you say this? 
      01:41:20 
                          MARGAERY 
                   Whenever I wanted to make a child with 
                   him, he... 
           Margaery sits beside Joffrey. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   ...he had so many excuses, so many 
                   late-night war councils.  He never 
                   wanted to try.  Except one evening, 
                   after he'd had far too much wine to 
                   drink, he suggested something--
                   something that sounded very painful and 
                   couldn't possibly result in children.  
                   Maybe the fault was with me. 
           Margaery looks away. 
            
      01:41:55 
                          JOFFREY 
                   No, he was a known...degenerate. 
           Margaery puts her hand on Joffrey's arm.

                   It's such a relief to hear you say so,   
                   Your Grace. 
      01:42:03 
                          JOFFREY 
                   Mmm.  I've considered making his 
                   perversion punishable by death. 
      01:42:11 
                          MARGAERY 
                   As is your right.  You must do 
                   whatever... 
           Margaery touches Joffrey's crossbow. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   ...you need to do.  You are the king. 
      01:42:24 
                          JOFFREY 
                   Yes.  I am. 
           Joffrey looks at his crossbow. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   Do you like it?  I just had it made.  
                   Probably one of the finest weapons in 
                   the Seven Kingdoms. 
      01:42:42 
                          MARGAERY 
                   It's beautiful.  Will you show me how 
                   it works? 
      01:42:50 
                          JOFFREY 
                   It's a new design.  Much easier to 
                   load.  There's no crank. 
           Joffrey shows Margaery how to load the crossbow. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                             65                       3/14/2012

                   You use this lever to draw the string.   
                   The bolt goes here.  And then you just 
                   aim... 
           Joffrey stands up and aims the crossbow at a trophy boar's 
           head hanged on the wall. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   and... 
           Joffrey fires at the trophy, hitting the boar's eyes. 
            
      01:43:17 
                          MARGAERY 
                   (laughs) 
           Margaery claps her hands and stands up. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   Would you take me hunting sometime? 
           Margaery moves closer to Joffrey. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   Forgive me, Your Grace.  I know a hunt 
                   is no place for a woman. 
      01:43:28 
                          JOFFREY 
                   It's not unheard of. 
      01:43:29 
                          MARGAERY 
                   My father would never let me before... 
      01:43:32 
                          JOFFREY 
                   You no longer belong to him.  Do you 
                   want to hold it? 
           Joffrey holds the crossbow close to Margaery.

                   May I?  Please. 
           Margaery moves closer to Joffrey and holds the crossbow.  
           Joffrey helps her aims the crossbow at the mirror. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   I imagine it must be so exciting to 
                   squeeze your finger here and watch 
                   something die over there.

           Lord Torturer stands up and walks in front of Theon. 
                          THEON (CONT'D) 
                   Wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  I took it

                          THEON (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...hated the Starks.  I hated them...

           Lord Torturer moves closer to Theon. 
                          THEON (CONT'D) 
                   What are you doing? 
           Lord Torturer puts the hood on Theon's head. 
                          THEON (CONT'D) 
                   Please. 
           Lord Torturer walks away.  The guard starts to twist the 
           corkscrew into Theon's feet.

                   (screaming) 
           The guards walk out of the dungeon. 
                          THEON (CONT'D) 
                   I'll tell you anything.  Just take it

                   Please.  Please, just take it off. 
           Reek moves closer to Theon.  He then takes off the hood

                   my bouts of sobriety.  It's very 
                   tedious for all concerned.  Now, how 
                   did three children...

                   How did three young persons such as

                   That criminal.  He charges twice as 
                   much as every other armorer in the 
                   city.

                          GENDRY 
                   That's because he's twice as good.

                   (grunts)  You shouldn't grimace before 
                   you lunge.  It gives away the game. 
      01:53:29 
                          BRIENNE 
                   (screams, grunts) 
      01:53:37 
                          JAIME (OS) 
                   Bit of a quandary for you.  If you... 
                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   ...kill me, you fail Lady Stark. 
                          JAIME (CONT'D - OS) 
                   But if you don't kill me... 
                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   ...I'm going to kill you.  (grunts)

                   You're good.  Graceless, but good.       
            
      01:53:58 
                          BRIENNE 
                   (grunts) 
      01:54:06 
                          JAIME 
                   See?  If you were willing to hurt me, 
                   you might have had me there. 
                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   (grunting) 
      01:54:28 
                          BRIENNE 
                   (grunts) 
      01:54:28 
                          JAIME 
                   (panting, groans) 
      01:54:29 
                          BRIENNE 
                   (grunts) 
      01:54:31 
                          JAIME 
                   (breathing heavily) 
           Brienne beats Jaime in their fight as he falls on the 
           ground. 
            
      01:54:43 
                          HORSE (OS) 
                   (neighs) 
           Jaime looks behind him and sees Locke and his men ride 
           their horses towards them.  Jaime stands up.

                          LOCKE 
                   Looks like your woman's getting the 
                   better of you, if you can call that... 
                          LOCKE (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...a woman. 
      01:54:59 
                          JAIME 
                   We enjoy a good fight.  Gets our juices 
                   flowing.  The Flayed Man of... 
                          JAIME (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...House Bolton.  A bit gruesome for my 
                   taste. 
      01:55:08 
                          LOCKE (OS) 
                   You sure he's the one? 
           A man brings the old man forward. 
            
      01:55:10 
                          OLD MAN 
                   That's him, all right.  I saw him fight 
                   at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's 
                   wedding. 
           Jaime looks back at Brienne. 
            
      01:55:17 
                          LOCKE 
                   Give the man his silver. 
           The man pulls the old man away. 
            
      01:55:21 
                          JAIME 
                   Let us go and my father will pay you 
                   whatever you want.

                          LOCKE 
                   Enough to buy me a new head? 
                          LOCKE (CONT'D - OS) 
                   If the King in the North hears, I had 
                   the Kingslayer and let him... 
                          LOCKE (CONT'D) 
                   ...go, he'll be taking it right off.  
                   I'd rather he takes yours. 
           Locke and his men move forward on the bridge while Jaime 
           and Brienne back pedal.
