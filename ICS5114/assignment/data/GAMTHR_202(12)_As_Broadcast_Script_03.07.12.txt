             EXT. RIVERLANDS – CROSSROADS - DAY 
             Arya is squatting by the river, urinating.  She hears 
             something and turns around.  Arya walks back to the 
             campsite pulling up her pants.  She begins to gather 
             firewood by a caged wagon.  
                                JAQEN 
                      Boy.   
             Arya turns and looks to three grotesque looking 
             prisoners.     
                                JAQEN 
                      Lovely boy. 
                                ARYA 
                      What do you want? 
             Arya stops at the wagon.  Jaqen lifts up his cup.   
                                JAQEN 
                      A man has a thirst. A man does not drink 
                      for a day and a night.     
             Arya approaches the wagon. 
                                JAQEN 
                      A boy could make a friend.   
                                ARYA 
                      I have friends.   
             Rorge rattles the cage angrily.

                                JAQEN 
                      A man does not choose his companions.  
                      These two they have no courtesy.  A man 
                      must ask forgiveness.  You’re called 
                      Arry. 
                       
       01:02:55   
             Arya nods.   
                                JAQEN 
                      This man has the honor to be Jaqen 
                      H’Qhar.  Once of the Free City of Laurell 
                      [PH]… 
                                RORGE 
                      Beer, you little shit.  Get us beer! 
             Arya drops the wood.   
                                AYRA 
                      You should’ve asked nicely.   
             Arya slaps a stick against the cage.   
                                RORGE 
                      Ah! 
             Ayra hits the cage again.  Rorge tries to grab the stick.   
                                RORGE 
                      Come closer and I’ll shove that stick up 
                      your bunghole and fuck you bloody! 
             Arya backs away. 
                                JAQEN 
                      A boy has more courage than sense.   
                                RORGE 
                      Come here! 
             Gendry walks by and Arya falls in step with him.  Gendry 
             is carrying a pile of firewood. 
                                GENDRY 
                      Yoren said none of us were to go near 
                      those three.

                      Come here! 
             Gendry and Arya walk away from the caged prisoners.   
                                ARYA 
                      They don’t scare me.   
                                GENDRY 
                      Hmm?  Then you’re stupid.  They scare me. 
                       
       01:03:31   
             Gendry continues to walk as Arya notices two Gold Cloaks 
             riding toward their camp.   
                                ARYA 
                      What are Gold Cloaks doing so far from 
                      King’s Landing?   
             Two gold cloaks riding their horses through the camp.  
             Arya hides behind a barrel.  Gendry continues to stack 
             his firewood and notices Arya hiding.    
                                GENDRY 
                      What you doing? 
                                ARYA 
                      They’re looking for me.   
                                GOLD CLOAK #1 
                      You in command here?  
             Yoren walks toward the two Gold Cloaks.  All the men in 
             the camp stop what they’re doing and watch.   
                                YOREN 
                      You’re a long way from home.  
                                GOLD CLOAK #1 
                      I asked you a question.  
                                YOREN 
                      Aye, you did.  But you asked without 
                      manners.  And I chose not to answer.    
             Gold Cloak #1 shows a rolled sealed document.    
                                GOLD CLOAK #1 
                      I have a royal warrant for one of these 
                      gutter rats you’re transporting.

           Yoren looks at the rolled sealed document.  
                           YOREN 
                   Well the thing is, these gutter rats 
                   belong to the Night’s Watch now.   That 
                   puts ‘em beyond the reach of Kings and 
                   Queens.   
           Gold Cloak #1 attempts to draw his sword but Yoren draws 
           his long knife and rests the blade on the cloak’s inner 
           thigh.  
                           YOREN 
                   It’s a funny thing.  People worry so much 
                   about their throats that they forget 
                   about what’s down low. 
      01:04:29 
           All the men in the camp are watching the events between 
           the Gold Cloak #1 and Yoren.   
                           YOREN 
                   Now I sharpened this blade before 
                   breakfast.  I could shave a spider’s arse 
                   if I wanted to.    
           Yoren grabs the Cloaks jacket and pushes it back and 
           presses the knife harder into his leg.   
                           YOREN 
                   Or, I could nick this artery in your leg 
                   and once it’s nicked, there’s no one 
                   around here [that] knows how to unnick 
                   it.  
           Yoren unsheathes the Gold Cloak’s sword.   
                           YOREN 
                   We’ll just keep that.   
           The second Gold Cloak draws his sword and the men in the 
           camp start to come toward the Yoren and the two Gold 
           Cloaks.  Yoren tosses the sword to the ground.   
                           YOREN 
                   Good steel is always needed on the Wall.  
                   It seems you have a choice.  You can die 
                   here at this Crossroads a long way from 
                   home, or you can go back to your city and

                      you were looking for.    
             The Gold Cloaks look around. 
                                GOLD CLOAK #1 
                      We’re looking for a boy named Gendry.  
             Gendry is shocked.  Arya is still hiding and looking at 
             Gendry.   
                                GOLD CLOAK #1 
                      He carries a bulls head helmet.  Anyone 
                      turning him over will earn the King’s 
                      reward.  We’ll be back with more men.  
                      And I’ll be taking your head home along 
                      with that bastard boy. 
                       
       01:05:29   
             The Gold Cloaks leave and Yoren puts his knife away.   
             Gendry and Arya stand up and watch the Gold Cloaks leave.  
             The entire camp turn and look at Gendry and Arya.

                                TYRION  
                      It was quite a battle.   
             Tyrion is not happy and continues into his chambers pass 
             Shae and Varys.  Varys sits back down.   
                                VARYS 
                      I heard you suffered a terrible head 
                      wound.  The Northerners are such fearsome 
                      warriors.    
             Tyrion pours himself a drink.   
                                SHAE 
                      And I tell him the story of how we meet.

                                VARYS 
                      To find so lovely a creature working in 
                      your father’s kitchens, it almost beggars 
                      belief.   
                                TYRION 
                      Strange things do happen.  You should 
                      taste her fish pie.   
                                SHAE 
                      I don’t think Lord Varys likes fish pie. 
             Tyrion walks back to Varys and Shae sitting at a table.   
                                VARYS 
                      How can you tell?   
                                SHAE 
                      I can always tell. 
                                TYRION 
                      Men like Lord Varys and I can’t let our 
                      disadvantages get the best of us.  We’ll 
                      make a fisherman of him yet.

                      I am glad your new friend was able to 
                      accompany you to the capital.  Friends 
                      are such an important part of life.  
                      Unfortunate that your father didn’t want 
                      her to come.  But rest easy my Lord, I am 
                      very good at keeping secrets for my good

                      Your discretion is legendary, where your

                      How unspeakable of me to go on and on 
                      when all you want to do is rest.  I will 
                      leave you.   
             Varys kiss Shae’s hand.  Tyrion walks to the door to let 
             Varys out.

                      Welcome to King’s Landing my dear.  This

                      We have a council meeting my Lord. 
       01:07:34 
             Shae gets up and exits the room.  Tyrion places his hand 
             on the door so Varys can’t open it.   
                                TYRION 
                      I don’t like threats.

                                TYRION 
                      I’m not Ned Stark.  I understand the way 
                      this game is played.

                      And I am not.  Threaten me again and I 
                      will have you thrown in to the sea.

                      Come my Lord.  We shouldn’t keep the 
                      Queen waiting.   
             Tyrion opens the door for Varys and himself to exit.   
             Varys closes the door. 
             INT. RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER – DAY  
             Alton Lannister stands before the small council, Tyrion, 
             Cersei, Varys, Littlefinger, Pycelle and Jason Slynt.  
         Cersei reads from the parchment.

                      From this time until the end of time we 
                      are not part of your realm but a free and 
                      independent kingdom of the North.  
             Cersei tears the paper into pieces.

                      He has more spirit than his father, I’ll

       01:08:30   
                                TYRION 
                      You’ve perfected the art of tearing up 
                      papers.  We can give him his father’s 
                      bones back at least as a gesture of good 
                      faith.

                      Safe travels, cousin. 
             Alton bows to the queen and council members and    
             leaves the room.

                      My blessed mother, I was holding her hand 
                      when she left this world.  She farted so 
                      hard the whole bed shook.   
             Without looking up or changing his expression, Dolorous 
             Edd demonstrates what it sounded like.

                      [MAKES NOISE] 
             Samwell watches one of Craster’s wives pass carrying two 
             dead chickens.   
                                SAMWELL 
                      Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so 
                      many wives.  Wouldn’t two or three be 
                      enough for him? 
                                DOLOROUS EDD 
                      We were having a serious discussion.

                      Would you look at that. 
             Samwell and Grenn watch two wives walk away from them.   
                                SAMWELL 
                      Nothing like the sight of a woman walking 
                      away.   
                                GRENN 
                      I prefer watching ‘em come towards me.   
                                SAMWELL 
                      I’m sure that’s nice too.

             Samwell is walking to get the potatoes and turnips.  He 
             hears a scream.

             Samwell stops and turns around and sees Gilly standing 
             with a skinned rabbit.  Ghost has Gilly pinned against 
             the tree because he wants the rabbit.  Samwell goes to 
             help Gilly. 
                                SAMWELL  
                      No.  Ghost, no.  No.  Ghost away.  Shoo.  
                      Shoo!   
             Ghost runs off.  Gilly watches the wolf run away to the 
             woods.

                      to make sure you weren’t hurt.    
             Gilly looks at Samwell.  They exchange looks.

             Jon sharpens his sword away from the other men.  Samwell 
             and Gilly approach him.

                      impossible.  The Lord Commander ordered

                      If it’s a boy what?   
             Gilly is uncomfortable and looks around worried someone

               Theon stands on the deck of the Myraham as it sails.  He 
               stares across the water at Pyke.   
               INT. SHIP’S CABIN – DAY  
               Theon steps inside the captain’s cabin where the 
               captain’s daughter lies naked on the bed waiting for him.   
                                    CAPTAIN’S DAUGHTER 
                         Is it as you remember, my Lord? 
                                    THEON 
                         It looks smaller.   
                                    CAPTAIN’S DAUGHTER 
                         Everything looks bigger when you’re a 
                         child.  I remember my father’s captain 
                         felt like a palace when I was little.  
                         Now look at it.  [LAUGH] 
               Theon is not paying attention and is removing his  
          clothes.   
                                    THEON 
                         They’ll be waiting for me on the docks.  
                                    CAPTAIN’S DAUGHTER 
                         Who will?   
                                    THEON 
                         Anyone who matters.  This is a big day 
                         for them.  They haven’t had much to get 
                         excited about since I left.  It’s a hard 
                         place the Iron Islands, always has been.  
                         It’s cold and it’s wet. 
                          
        01:18:31   
                                    CAPTAIN’S DAUGHTER 
                         Oh-I love the cold and wet.   
                                    THEON 
                         They say hard places breed hard men. 
                         [SNIFF] And hard men rule the world.   
               Captain’s daughter helps to take off Theon’s pants.   
                                    CAPTAIN’S DAUGHTER 
                         And you’ll be kind before long.  [LAUGH]

             Theon squats down.   
                                THEON 
                      Try smiling with your lips closed.   
             Captain’s daughter smiles with her lips closed as asked.   
                                THEON 
                      [LAUGH] Better.   
             Theon pushes her down on the bed.   
                                CAPTAIN’S DAUGHTER 
                      My father doesn’t trust you Iron 
                      Islanders.   
                                THEON 
                      I don’t blame him.   
             Theon takes off his pants.   
                                CAPTAIN’S DAUGHTER 
                      He says that you’re all reavers and 
                      rapers, and that no matter how many women 
                      you have, you’ll never be satis… ah! 
             Theon thrusts himself inside of her.    
                                THEON 
                      Quit talking about your father.

             They begin to have sex.   
                                THEON 
                      [MOAN] He’s right about us. [GRUNT] Our 
                      wives from the Iron Islands, they’re for 
                      breeding.  But that’s not enough for us.  
                      That’s why we take salt wives.  The women 
                      we capture.  [GRUNT]

                      ashore.  Make me your salt wife.

                      Not after you leave.  Father will punish  
                      me.  He’ll call me a whore.

             INT. LITTLEFINGER’S BROTHER – LARGER ROOM – DAY 
             A plump naked lord stares at the couple having sex  
             through a hole in a golden screen.  He is standing while 
             Aremca’s on her knees performing fellatio.   
             INT. LITTLEFINGER’S BROTHEL – DAY  
                      Littlefinger is watching through a peep hole 
                      when he hears noises coming from down the 
                      hall.  He closes the peep hole and proceeds 
                      out of the room into the next room.

                                DISGRUNTLED PATRON 
                      Unbelievable.  [INAUDIBLE] I’m not gonna 
                      stand for this.   
             A disgruntled patron is closing up his pants and sees  
             Littlefinger.  He approaches him.     
                                DISGRUNTLED PATRON 
                      I barely touched her.  And you charge

                      And this is what I get?  Crying?   
                                LITTLEFINGER 
                      One moment my friend, a moment.   
             Littlefinger snaps his fingers to Aremca.  She comes  
             right over.  He examines her and wipes her mouth. 
                                LITTLEFINGER 
                      Please accept my sincerest apologies.  
                      Aremca will take good care of you.     
             Aremca walks up the disgruntle patron and begins to kiss 
             him.  Littlefinger walks away and into the other room  
             with Ros.  Ros is sitting on the bed crying.    
             Littlefinger sits down next to her.   
                                ROS 
                      [CRYING] I’m sorry my Lord.

                                ROS 
                      [SNIFF] She works for you.  She’s the one 
                      … the gold cloaks … they killed her baby.   
                                LITTLEFINGER

                      You know you remind me of another girl.  
                      A lovely thing I once acquired from a 
                      Lysene pleasure house.  Beautiful, like 
                      yourself and intelligent, like yourself.  
                      But she wasn’t happy.  She cried often.  
                      I asked her why but, we didn’t have the 
                      kind of rapport that you and I have.

                                LITTLEFINGER 
                      Yes, it was quite sad.  Girls from the 
                      Lysene pleasure houses are expensive.  
                      Extremely expensive.  And this one wasn’t 
                      making me any money.   
             Ros realizes that Littlefinger is not happy with her.   
                                LITTLEFINGER 
                      I hate bad investments.  Really I-I do.  
                      They haunt me.  And I had no idea how to 
                      make her happy.  And no idea how to 
                      mitigate my losses.  A very wealthy 
                      patron, he offered a tremendous amount of 
                      money to let him transform this lovely 
                      sad girl, to use her in ways that would 
                      never occur to most men.  But you know 
                      what occurs to most men? 
                       
       01:23:30   
                       
                                LITTLEFINGER 
                      I would not say he succeed in making her 
                      happy, but my losses were definitely 
                      mitigated.   
             Littlefinger gets up and stands in front of Ros.   
                                LITTLEFINGER 
                      Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen’s 
                      child.  I’ll see you tomorrow.  And 
                      you’ll be happy.    
             Ros shakes her head and smiles.   
                                LITTLEFINGER 
                      That makes me happy.

             Wine is being poured in a glass and is spilled.

                      Damn it boy!

                                PODRICK 
                      Apologies, my Lord.   
             Tyrion and Janos Slynt are sitting at a table.   
                                TYRION 
                      Leave us Podrick.  I believe we know how 
                      to pour our own wine.   
             Podrick leaves.

                      That’s your new squire?  I could have 
                      found you a proper lad.

                   I heard there was some trouble in 
                   Littlefinger’s Brothel the other night.   
                           JANOS SLYNT 
                   Hmmm.   Nasty business.  Had to be done.   
                           TYRION 
                   Yes of course.  The City Watch must keep 
                   the peace.  Only, I hadn’t realized peace 
                   depended on killing babies.

                   Quite right.  Especially the Queen’s 
                   orders.   
                           JANOS SLYNT 
                   I never said they were the Queen’s 
                   orders.

                   No but, who else would want to murder

                      I appreciate your loyalty.  Tell me, when 
                      your men slaughtered Ned Stark’s men in

                      I did.  And I would again.  The man was a 
                      traitor.  He tried to buy my loyalty.

                      I saw a man kill another man just outside 
                      a tavern in Flea Bottom.  Stabbed him

                      a battle.   
             Lommy and Hot Pie look at Gendry very nervously.   
                                HOT PIE 
                      It’s ah when they’ve got armor on.

                      ‘Cause I sold armor.   
             Hot pie and Lommy exchange looks and get up and leave.  
             Arya gets up too and walks over to Gendry. Gendry is  
             filling buckets with water.

                      are bigger than you.   
                                ARYA 
                      Then I wouldn’t get to insult anyone.   
                      Gendry and Arya carry the buckets of

                      before?   
             Gendry pours the buckets of water in the pot.

                      Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before 
                      he died and then Lord Stark came a few 
                      weeks before he died.   
             Arya’s eyes widen when Gendry mentions her father.

                      Why?  Did you kill someone or is it just

       01:32:33   
             The man stares at Theon blankly.   
                                THEON 
                      The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.   
             He continues to stare.   
                                THEON 
                      Me.   
                                IRON ISLANDER 
                      I don’t like wine.  Woman’s drink.   
                                THEON 
                      I need to get to Pyke.   
             Theon reaches and gets a coin from his pocket and hands 
             it to the man. The man takes it.   
                                IRON ISLANDER  
                      I’ll find you a horse.   
             The man walks away.  Theon looks down and the Shiphand is 
             already rowing back to the ship.   
                                ESGRED 
                      I’m heading that way.     
             Theon turns to see Esgred. 
                                ESGRED 
                      I can take you there.   
                                THEON 
                      I bet you can.   
                                ESGRED 
                      You been at sea long?  Or were there just 
                      no women where you came from?   
             Esgred and Theon start walking.   
                                THEON 
                      None like you.

                      You don’t know what I’m like.   
                                THEON 
                      Maybe you don’t know what you’re like.  
                      Maybe you need someone to teach you.  Do 
                      you know who I am? 
       01:33:38 
                                ESGRED 
                      You think I offer free rides to every man 
                      in jewelry.  Lord Greyjoy.   
             The man appears with a horse.  Theon tosses another coin 
             to the man.   
                                THEON 
                      Have my things sent up to the castle.   
             Theon walks right past the man with Esgred.  The man  
             examines the coin and watches him walk away.   
             EXT. ROAD TO PYKE – DAY 
             Theon rides behind Esgred on her horse.   
                                THEON 
                      Won’t you give me the reins.  I’m a 
                      better rider than you.  Been on horseback 
                      for the past nine years.   
                                ESGRED 
                      Nine years.  Do you still know your way 
                      around a ship?  Have these hands ever 
                      touched a rope?   
                                THEON 
                      Don’t you worry about my hands.   
             Theon reaches inside Esgred shirt to fondle her breasts.   
                                THEON 
                      The sea is in my blood.   
                                ESGRED 
                      Your blood will be in the sea if I don’t 
                      watch where I’m going.   
                                THEON 
                      I have a proposal for my father.

             Theon slides his hand down her pants.   
                                THEON 
                      One that will make him king again.  And 
                      me after him.  You may get to stay in a 
                      castle tonight, if you’re lucky. 
                       
       01:34:41   
                                ESGRED 
                      Is that an offer from my future king?   
                                THEON 
                      An order from your future king.  You can 
                      tell your grandchildren about this night.   
                                ESGRED 
                      I don’t imagine it’ll be a story fit for 
                      children.   
             They continue to ride by horseback up to the castle.   
             INT. PYKE- BALON GREYJOY’S CHAMBER - DAY 
             Theon steps inside the chamber.  An old man is sitting at 
             the far end of the room by the fire.   
                                THEON 
                      Father.   
                                BALON 
                      Nine years is it?  They took a frightened 
                      boy.  What have they given back?   
                                THEON 
                      A man.  Your blood and your heir.   
                                BALON 
                      We shall see.  Stark had you longer than 
                      I did.   
                                THEON 
                      Lord Stark is gone. 
                       
       01:35:30   
             Balon turns to Theon.   
                                BALON 
                      And how do you feel about that?

                                THEON 
                      What’s done is done.  I’ve brought you a 
                      proposal from Robb Stark?   
                                BALON 
                      Who gave you those clothes?   
             Balon gets up from his chair and walks toward Theon.   
                                BALON 
                      Was it Ned Stark’s pleasure to make you 
                      his daughter?   
                                THEON 
                      If my clothes offend you I will change 
                      them.   
                                BALON 
                      You will.  That bauble around your neck, 
                      did you pay the iron price for it, or the 
                      gold?  I asked a question.  Did you pull 
                      it from the neck of a corpse you made, or 
                      did you buy it to match your fine 
                      clothes?  Iron or gold?   
                                THEON 
                      Gold.   
             Balon yanks the chain off his son’s neck and his cloak 
         falls on the floor.  Balon turns and walks towards the 
         fire.       
                                BALON 
                      I’ll not have my son dressed as a whore.  
                      My fears have come true.  The Starks have 
                      made you theirs. 
                       
       01:36:34   
                                THEON 
                      My blood is salt and iron.   
                                BALON 
                      Yet the Stark boy sends you to me like a 
                      trained raven, clutching his message.   
                                THEON 
                      The offer he makes is one I proposed.

                      He heeds your counsel.   
                                THEON 
                      I’ve lived with him, hunted with him, 
                      fought at his side.  He thinks of me as a 
                      brother.  
                                BALON 
                      No!  Not here.   
             Balon walks towards Theon. 
                                BALON 
                      Not in my hearing, you will not name him 
                      brother.  This son of the man who put 
                      your true brothers to the sword or have 
                      you forgotten your own blood?   
                                THEON 
                      I forget nothing.  I remember my 
                      brothers.  And I remember when my father 
                      was a King.   
             Theon holds out a letter.  Balon takes the     
             letter and looks at it. 
       01:37:26   
                                BALON 
                      I see.  I destroy Robb Stark’s enemies 
                      for him and he will make me King of the 
                      Iron Islands once again.   
                                THEON 
                      I will lead the attack myself.   
                                BALON 
                      Oh you will?   
                                THEON 
                      I’m your son.  Your only living heir.  
                      Who else?   
             The door opens and Theon turns to see who it is.   
                                THEON 
                      I told you to wait outside.   
             Esgred walks into the room.

                      Anything with a cock is easy to fool.   
             Esgred walks past Theon and to Balon. 
                                BALON 
                      My dear.   
             Balon puts his arm around Esgred.  Theon stands in shock.   
                                THEON 
                      Yara?

                      You’re the one in skirts.

                      This isn’t Winterfell, boy.  Your sister 
                      took over command of your eldest

                      The only night she’s spent off these 
                      islands have been spent on the sea.  
                      She’s commanded men.  She’s killed men.  
                      And she knows who she is.   
             Balon catches the letter on fire, watches it burn then 
         tosses it in fire.   
                                BALON 
                      No man gives me a crown.  I pay the iron 
                      price.  I will take my crown.  For that 
                      is who I am.  That is who we have always 
                      been.   
             Balon walks to leave the room and Yara follows in line 
         after him.  Theon yells after them.  
                                THEON  
                      You won’t stand a chance against the 
                      Lannisters on your own.   
                                BALON 
                      Who said anything about the Lannisters?   
             EXT. DRAGONSTONE – BEACH - DAY 
             Davis Seaworth, Matthos, and Salladhor Saan are walking 
             along the beach. 
                                DAVOS 
                      You’ll have your gold when we take the 
                      treasury at King’s Landing.   
                                SALLADHOR SAAN 
                      All these kings fighting for the throne 
                      and this Stannis has the smallest army.  
                      Why would I bet on the man with the worst 
                      chance? 
                                DAVOS 
                      Because you’re a smart gambler.  Stannis 
                      has proved himself in war, twice.  His 
                      baby brother has never set foot on a 
                      battlefield.  Neither has the false King 
                      Joffrey.

                      And yet they both have larger armies.   
                                DAVIS 
                      Well Stannis has just begun the fight.  
                      His bannermen will rally to his cause.  
                      There’s no man in the Seven Kingdoms more 
                      honorable than Stannis Baratheon, or more 
                      worthy of loyalty. 
                                SALLADHOR SAAN 
                      What is the world coming to when 
                      smugglers must vouch for the honor of 
                      kings?   
                                MATTHOS 
                      You mind your words pirate … 
             The men stop walking.  
                                DAVOS 
                      Matthos.   
                                SALLADHOR SAAN 
                      Do you think I’m insulted?  I am a 
                      pirate.  I’m an excellent pirate.  I 
                      don’t sail for promises.   
                                DAVOS 
                      Of course you do.  Every time you leave 
                      harbor you’re leaving on a promise.  A 
                      promise that somewhere on the seas 
                      somebody’s got some gold and you can take 
                      it from ‘em.   
                                SALLADHOR SAAN 
                      That’s a promise that always comes true.   
                                DAVOS 
                      As is mine.  You’re not a young man 
                      Salladhor.  And correct me if I’m wrong, 
                      but most pirates don’t grow old.   
                                SALLADHOR SAAN 
                      Only the clever ones.

                      You’ll be the richest man in Lys.  And 
                      the most famous.  They’ll be singing

                      Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.   
                                DAVOS 
                      It is.   
                                SALLADHOR SAAN 
                      One thing.  I want the Queen.   
                                DAVOS 
                      The Queen?   
                                SALLADHOR SAAN 
                      Cersei.  I want her.  I’ll sail with your 
                      fleet, all thirty of my ships and if we 
                      don’t drown at the bottom of Blackwater 
                      Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I 
                      will fuck her well.   
                                MATTHOS 
                      This war isn’t about you.  We’re not 
                      attacking King’s Landing so that you can 
                      rape the Queen.

                      fuck her.   
                                MATTHOS 
                      As if she would just let you.

                      You don’t know how persuasive I am.  I 
                      never tried to fuck you.

                      I’ve been all over the world my boy and 
                      everywhere I go people tell me about the 
                      true Gods.  They all think they found the 
                      right one.  The one true God is what's 
                      between a woman’s legs.  And better yet, 
                      a Queen’s legs.   
             Matthos backs away from Salladhor Saan completely

                                DAVOS  
                      As soon as his god wills it.

                      I wish I had a god.  Truly.  Now I’m not 
                      mocking you but I’ve seen men pr-pray to 
                      every god there is.  Pray for wind, pray 
                      for rain, pray for home.  None of it

                                MATTHOS 
                      No.  But I was.  Every night that you 
                      were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed 
                      for you.

                      Stannis is my god.  He raised me up and 
                      blessed me with his trust.  He gave you a 
                      future I could never have imagined.  You 
                      know how to read.  You’ll be a knight

                      Lord Janos Slynt was the Commander of the

                      Joffrey didn’t even tell you.  Did he 
                      tell you?  I imagine that would be even 
                      worse.

                      He did what needed to be done.  You

                      want to rule?  This is what ruling 
                      is.  Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping 
                      them out by the root one by one 
                      before they strangle you in your

                      I’m no king but I think there’s more to

             Davos arranges pieces on the map as Matthos watches.  
             Stannis enters the room with Melisandre. 
                                DAVOS 
                      Your Grace.   
                                MATTHOS 
                      Your Grace.

                      How did you fare with your pirate?   
             Stannis and Melisandre approach the table with the map.   
                                DAVOS 
                      Salladhor Saan will join our fleet.  
                      Thirty ships.  His men know how to fight.   
                                STANNIS 
                      In my experience, pirates prefer fighting 
                      unarmed men.   
                                DAVOS 
                      It does seem the wiser choice. 
                                STANNIS 
                      There won’t be a choice, this time.  Do 
                      you trust him? 
                       
       01:46:29   
                                DAVOS 
                      Salladhor Saan is an old friend.  I’ve 
                      known him thirty years.  I’ve never 
                      trusted him.  Now once he gets the smell 
                      of gold he never stops.

                                STANNIS 
                      Leave us.

                      At once your Grace.   
             Davos and Matthos leave the room.  As Matthos walks by

             Melisandre leans to his ear and whispers something in his 
             ear as Stannis and Davos watch.  They are not happy.

                      Come.

             alone.

                                MELISANDRE 
                      You must give all of yourself.   
             Melisandre steps very close to Stannis and opens her  
             robe.  She is naked.

                      I have a wife.   
             Stannis walks away from Melisandre who follows.   
                                STANNIS 
                      I took a vow.   
                                MELISANDRE 
                      She’s sickly.  Weak.  And shut away in a 
                      tower.  She disgusts you.   
             Melisandre steps very close to Stannis again.  She begins 
             to touch his head.   
                                MELISANDRE 
                      And she’s given you nothing.  No sons.  
                      Only stillborns.  Only death.   
             Melisandre presses her body against Stannis and whispers 
             in his ear.   
                                MELISANDRE 
                      I will give you a son my King.

                      A son?   
             Melisandre begins to kiss his ear.  Stannis tears off her 
             robe and they begin to kiss.  Stannis throws her on the 
             map table and they have sex. Pieces from the map   
             table fall on the floor.

             Jon stands on duty.  He sees a figure walking through the 
             camp.  It’s Craster and he’s carrying a baby and goes

             comes walking by.   
             Jon hears a baby’s cry.  Jon runs to find the baby.  He 
             draws his sword.  He frantically looks for the baby.

             Jon sees the baby as a white walker picks up the infant. 
             All the sudden Jon is grabbed on the shoulder and it’s 
             Craster.  Craster raises an axe and smashes his head.
