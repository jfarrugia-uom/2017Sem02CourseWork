                        The Dothraki have two things in
                        abundance. Grass and horses, and people
                        can’t live on grass.

                        In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they
                        say there are fields of ghost grass with
                        stocks as pale as milk that glow in the
                        night. It murders all other grass. The
                        Dothraki believe that one day it’ll
                        cover everything. That’s the way the
                        world will end.

                   Magister Illyrio has extended his
                   hospitality.You’d be more comfortable
                   there.
                            VISERYS
                   I have no interest in hospitality or
                   comfort. I’ll stay with Drogo until he
                   fulfills his end of the bargain and I
                   have my crown.
                            JORAH
                   If you wish your grace.

                   Well Mormont as brutish as this life is,
                   I suppose it is preferable to beheading.
                   What did Ned Stark want you for?Buying
                   from a slaver?

                   Selling to one. Some poachers I caught
                   on my land.
                            VISERYS
                   Under my reign you won’t be punished for
                   such nonsense. You can rest assured of
                   that.

               EXT. WINTERFELL COURTYARD - DAY
               TYRION WAKES UP IN THE DOG PEN. JOFFREY IS STANDING
               OUTSIDE THE DOG PEN AND LOOKING DOWN AT HIM.
                                    JOFFREY
                        Better looking bitches than you’re used
                        to Uncle?
               TYRION GETS UP TO SEE THE HOUND AND JOFFREY ARE STARING
               DOWN AT HIM.
                                    JOFFREY
                        My mother’s been looking for you. We
                        ride for King’s Landing today.
                                    TYRION
                        Before you go you will call on Lord and
                        Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.
                                    JOFFREY
                        What good will my sympathies do them?
               TYRION EXITS DOGPEN.
                                    TYRION
                        None. But it is expected of you. Your
                        absence is already been noted.
                                    JOFFREY
                        The boy means nothing to me. And I
                        can’t stand the wailing of women.
               TYRION SLAPS JOFFREY.
                                    JOFFREY
                        Ah!
                                    TYRION
                        One word and I hit you again.
                                    JOFFREY
                        I’m telling mother!
               TYRION HITS JOFFREY AGAIN.

                         Go. Tell her. But first you will get
                         to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall
                         on your knees in front of them and tell
                         them how very sorry you are. That
                         you’re at their service and that all
                         your prayers are with them. Do you
                         understand?
                                    JOFFREY
                         You can’t …
               TYRION HITS JOFFREY AGAIN.
                                    JOFFREY
                         Ah!

                         Do you understand?
               JOFFREY WALKS AWAY.
                                    HOUND
                         The prince will remember that little
                         lord.
                                    TYRION
                         I hope so. If he forgets be a good dog
                         and remind him.
               TYRION WALKS AWAY THROUGH THE COURTYARD.
                                    TYRION
                         Ahh! Time for breakfast.
               INT. WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL – MORNING

                         Bread and two of those little fish. And
                         a mug of dark beer to wash it down.

                            CERSEI
                   What do you mean?
                            TYRION
                   The maester says the boy may live.
                            CERSEI
                   It’s no mercy letting a child linger in
                   such pain.
                            TYRION
                   Only the gods know for certain. All the
                   rest of us can do is pray. The charms
                   of the north seem entirely lost on you.
                            CERSEI
                   I still can’t believe you’re going.
                   It’s ridiculous even for you.
                            TYRION
                   Where’s your sense of wonder? The
                   greatest structure ever built. The
                   intrepid men of the Night’s Watch. The
                   wintry abode of the White Walkers.

                         begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock.
                         No, I just want to stand on top of the
                         Wall and piss off the edge of the world.

                         cripple, grotesque. Give me a good
                         clean death any day.

                         Speaking for the grotesques, I’d have to
                         disagree. Death is so final where as
                         life, ah, life is full of possibilities.
                         I hope the boy does wake. I’d be very
                         interested to hear what he has to say.

                         My dear brother, you wound me. You know
                         how much I love my family.

                        was a fighter too. Tried to beat the
                        fever that took him. Forgive me. It’s
                        the last thing you need to hear right
                        now.

                        I never knew.

                        It was years ago. Robert was crazed,
                        beat his hands bloody on the wall. All
                        the things men do to show you how much
                        they care. The boy looked just like
                        him. Such a little thing. A bird
                        without feathers. They came to take his
                        body away and Robert held me, I screamed
                        and I battled, but he held me. Our
                        little bundle. They took him away and I
                        never saw him again. Never visited the
                        crypt. Never. I pray to the mother
                        every morning and night that she return
                        your child to you.
                                    CATELYN
                        I am grateful.
                                    CERSEI
                        Perhaps this time she’ll listen.
               CERSEI LEAVES THE ROOM. CATELYN RISES AND TOUCHES BRAN’S
               FACE AND THEN SITS BACK DOWN AND HOLDS HIS HAND.

                   it for you special. It won’t hack a

                   of holes if you’re quick enough.

                        He told me the moon was an egg,
                        Khaleesi. That once there were two
                        moons in the sky but one wandered too
                        close to the sun and it cracked from the
                        heat. Out of it poured a thousand
                        thousand dragons and they drank the
                        sun’s fire.

                   Why did the trader from Qarth tell you
                   these stories?
                            DOREAH
                   Men like to talk when they’re happy.
                   Before your brother bought me for you it
                   was job to make men happy.

                   Can you teach me how to make the Khal

                   What I am about to tell must remain
                   between us. I don’t think Bran fell
                   from that tower. I think he was thrown.
                            LUWIN
                   The boy was always surefooted before.

                   Someone tried to kill him twice.Why?
                   Why murder an innocent child, unless he
                   saw something he wasn’t meant to see.

                   Saw what my lady?

                   I don’t know. But I would stake my life
                   the Lannisters are involved. We already
                   have reason to suspect their loyalty to
                   the crown.

                   Did you notice the dagger the killer
                   used? It’s too fine a weapon for such a
                   man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the
                   handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to
