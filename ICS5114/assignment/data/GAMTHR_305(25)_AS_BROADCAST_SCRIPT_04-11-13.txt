                   Show us the truth.  Strike this man 
                   down if he is guilty.  Give strength to 
                   his sword if he is true. 
           Anguy walks away.

           Thoros walks towards a sword and picks it up.  The Hound plays 
           with his sword.  Thoros walks back to Beric with the sword.  He 
           then cuts Beric's hands with the sword then hands it to him.  
           Beric takes the sword, runs it against the wound on his hand 
           causing the sword to catch fire.

                   builders to check for structural 
                   damage, two rangers to watch for

                          ORELL 
                   Liar.

           Jon Snow drops the firewood and moves closer to Orell.  
            
      01:06:55 
                          JON SNOW 
                   What happens to your eagle after I kill 
                   you?  Does he drift away like a kite 
                   with his strings cut or does he just 
                   flop dead to the ground? 
      01:07:02 
                          YGRITTE 
                   He's no crow. 
      01:07:04      
                          ORELL 
                   Just 'cause you want him inside you 
                   don't make him one of us. 
           Ygritte pulls out her dagger and points it at Orell. 
            
      01:07:07 
                          YGRITTE 
                   I'm not afraid of you. 
           Orell shoves her.  Tormund stands up, grabs Orell from the back 
           and shoves him to the ground.  He then moves closer to Jon Snow. 
            
      01:07:15 
                          TORMUND 
                   I like you, boy.  But if you lie to me, 
                   I'll pull your guts out through your 
                   throat. 
      01:07:26 
                          JON SNOW 
                   1,000 men. 
           Orell stands up.

                   We'll find out soon enough. 
           Tormund walks away.  Jon Snow and Ygritte continue walking. 
            
      01:07:43 
                          JON SNOW 
                   I don't need you to protect me. 
      01:07:45      
                          YGRITTE 
                   Of course you do.  Who stopped 
                   Rattleshirt when he was about to cut 
                   your throat? 
           Ygritte walks in front of Jon Snow and faces him. 
                          YGRITTE (CONT'D) 
                   Who vouched for you with Mance?  It 
                   seems you owe me a debt. 
           Ygritte pulls out Jon Snow's sword and walks away.  Jon Snow 
           tries to grab her. 
            
      01:07:55 
                          JON SNOW 
                   Give it back. 
      01:07:56 
                          YGRITTE 
                   Well, I stole it.  It's mine.  If you 
                   want it... 
           Ygritte grabs a torch from the campfire. 
                          YGRITTE (CONT'D) 
                   ...come steal it back. 
      [MUSIC IN] 
            
           Ygritte runs away.  Jon Snow runs after her.

                   Ygritte!  Ygritte! 
           Ygritte enters a cave. 
            
           INT. BEYOND THE WALL - CAVE - CONTINUOUS. 
            
           Jon Snow peeps inside the cave from the opening. 
                          JON SNOW (CONT'D) 
                   Ygritte!  Seven hells. 
           Ygritte puts his sword beside the rock. 
                          JON SNOW (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Ygritte! 
           Ygritte walks to another rock, puts the torch beside it and 
           turns back to Jon Snow. 
            
      01:08:20 
                          YGRITTE 
                   Is Orell right?  Are you still a crow? 
           Ygritte starts taking her clothes off. 
                          YGRITTE (CONT'D) 
                   It's time you proved yourself. 
      01:08:30 
                          JON SNOW 
                   Ygritte. 
      01:08:31      
                          YGRITTE 
                   You swore some vows.  I want you to 
                   break 'em.  I want you to see me.  All 
                   of me. 
           Ygritte moves closer to Jon Snow, naked.

                   We shouldn't. 
      01:09:04      
                          YGRITTE 
                   We should. 
           Ygritte tries to kiss Jon Snow, but he moves his head back.  
           Ygritte tries again and the two start kissing. 
                          YGRITTE (CONT'D) 
                   (breathing heavily) 
           Jon Snow starts going down as he kisses Ygritte's body. 
                          YGRITTE (CONT'D) 
                   Why are you still dressed?  You know 
                   nothing, Jon Sno--(moaning) 
           Jon Snow is lying on the ground.  Ygritte, who is lying behind 
           Jon Snow, looks at him. 
                          YGRITTE (CONT'D) 
                   That thing you did with your mouth--is 
                   that what lords do to their ladies in 
                   the South? 
           Jon Snow turns to Ygritte. 
            
      01:09:54 
                          JON SNOW 
                   I don't know.  I just wanted to kiss 
                   you there is all. 
      01:09:57 
                          YGRITTE 
                   Hmm. 
      01:09:59      
                          JON SNOW 
                   You seemed to like it.

                   Aye, I liked it some.  Who taught you 
                   that? 
      01:10:05 
                          JON SNOW 
                   There's been no one else.  Only you. 
      01:10:08      
                          YGRITTE 
                   A maid.  You were a maid. 
      01:10:12 
                          JON SNOW 
                   I was a man of the Night's Watch.  How 
                   about you?  Were you a maid? 
      01:10:18 
                          YGRITTE 
                   What do you think? 
      01:10:19      
                          JON SNOW 
                   Who was he? 
      01:10:21 
                          YGRITTE 
                   Just a boy.  He came trading with his 
                   brothers.  He had red hair like me.  
                   Kissed by fire.  But...he was weak.  
                   Not like you.  That was the first one.  
                   Then there was this Thenn boy.  Spoke 
                   no Common, but gods, he was built like 
                   a mammoth.

                   Yeah, thanks.  I think I've heard        
                   enough.  We'd best get back.  
                   Tormund... 
           Jon Snow tries to gets up.  Ygritte stops him and mounts on top 
           of him. 
            
      01:10:54 
                          YGRITTE 
                   I'm not done with you yet. 
           Ygritte kisses Jon Snow. 
                          YGRITTE (CONT'D) 
                   How long's it been since you had a 
                   bath? 
           Ygritte runs towards the pool and jumps into it.  Jon Snow 
           follows her.  Ygritte and Jon Snow moves closer to each other 
           and kiss. 
                          YGRITTE (CONT'D) 
                   Let's not go back.  Let's stay here a 
                   while longer.  I don't ever want to 
                   leave this cave, Jon Snow.  Not ever. 
           Jon Snow and Ygritte continue kissing.

               The Hound throws the note on the floor.

           Anguy throws a sword to The Hound. 
                          BERIC (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Go in peace...

                   ...Sandor Clegane. 
           Anguy walks towards The Hound. 
                          BERIC (CONT'D) 
                   The Lord of Light isn't done with you 
                   yet. 
           Anguy puts the hood on The Hound's head.  The men lead The Hound 
           out the cave.

                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   Is there word from the Capital?

           Jaime kneels on the ground while holding Roose's hand.

                   Ser Jaime isn't well.  Take him to

           A man grabs Brienne by the arm and pulls her away.  Two men help 
           Jaime stand up. 
            
           INT. HARRENHAL – QYBURN'S ROOM – CONTINUOUS. 
            
           Qyburn is in the room tending on Jaime's wounded arm.

      01:14:31 
                          QYBURN 
                   No.  The corruption has spread.  I fear 
                   it must be cut away.  The safest course 
                   would be to take the whole arm off. 
      01:14:39 
                          JAIME 
                   Then you'll die.  You're no maester.

                   They found some of my experiments... 
           Qyburn takes a surgical tweezer from the table. 
                          QYBURN (CONT'D) 
                   ...too bold.  I can leave your upper 
                   arm, make the cut at your elbow. 
           Jaime grabs Qyburn by the neck.

                          QYBURN 
                   I can take away the rotting flesh and 
                   try and burn out the corruption with 
                   boiling wine.

                   With any luck, that will suffice.  
                   You'll need milk of the poppy. 
           Qyburn takes a bottle from the table.  Jaime shakes his head.

                          JAIME

                   Quite a bit of pain.

           Qyburn takes a strap from the table and locks Jaime's arm on the 
           arm rest with it.  He then starts cutting the rotting flesh on 
           Jaime's cut arm.

           Cersei and Littlefinger stop walking and face each other.

                   Thank you.  And your best will prove 
                   better than when I asked you to locate 
                   Arya Stark?

                   I assure you that it will.

           INT. KINGS LANDING - TYRION'S HOUSE – DAY. 
            
           Tyrion and Olenna are at a table. 
            
      01:16:48 
                          OLENNA (OS) 
                   Gods, boy, that's enough. 
           Podrick is pouring drink into Olenna's glass. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   We're not in a tavern. 
      01:16:51      
                          PODRICK 
                   Pardon, my lady. 
      01:16:51 
                          OLENNA 
                   No need to speak. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Are there any figs? 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   Fetch some. 
           Tyrion gestures Podrick to obey Olenna's request.  Podrick puts 
           the pitcher on the table and walks away.

                   I always take figs midafternoon.  They 
                   help move the bowels.  To what do I owe 
                   this summons? 
      01:17:00 
                          TYRION 
                   Thank you for seeing me, my lady.  I 
                   had hoped we might discuss a few 
                   financial matters. 
      01:17:04 
                          OLENNA 
                   I climbed all those steps to discuss 
                   financial matters? 
      01:17:08      
                          TYRION 
                   It's the royal wedding.  I'm told you 
                   had a hand in planning it. 
      01:17:11 
                          OLENNA 
                   Naturally. 
      01:17:12      
                          TYRION 
                   It's shaping up to be a very involved 
                   affair.  The word extravagant has been 
                   used. 
      01:17:17 
                          OLENNA 
                   What good is the word extravagant if it 
                   can't be used to describe a royal 
                   wedding? 
      01:17:21 
                          TYRION 
                   I understand that.

                          OLENNA 
                   Good. 
      01:17:23      
                          TYRION 
                   But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon 
                   me to calculate the cost for the crown.  
                   As of now, it's a huge expense. 
      01:17:29 
                          OLENNA 
                   And? 
      01:17:31      
                          TYRION 
                   And we're at war, Lady Olenna. 
      01:17:35      
                          OLENNA 
                   Oh, I'd nearly forgotten. 
      01:17:37      
                          TYRION 
                   Yes, and maintaining supply lines...

                          OLENNA (OS) 
                   I can't think how it slipped my mind.  
                   What is it, 12,000... 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D)

                          OLENNA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...the Tyrell family has supplied? 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   1,800 mounted lances.

                   20,000 head of cattle.  50,000 sheep. 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   You don't have to lecture me about 
                   wartime expenses.  I'm quite familiar 
                   with them. 
      01:18:04 
                          TYRION 
                   And we are so grateful for your 
                   contributions, which are necessary for 
                   the preservation of the realm. 
      01:18:09 
                          OLENNA 
                   As is a royal wedding.  The people are 
                   hungry for more than just food.  They 
                   crave distractions. 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   And if we don't provide them...

                          OLENNA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   A royal wedding is much safer. 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   Wouldn't you say? 
      01:18:28      
                          TYRION 
                   I would. 
      01:18:29      
                          OLENNA (OS) 
                   And traditionally paid for... 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   ...by the royal family. 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   I was told... 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   ...you were drunk, impertinent, and 
                   thoroughly debauched.  You can imagine 
                   my disappointment at finding nothing 
                   but a browbeaten bookkeeper. 
           Podrick walks back to the table with a plate of figs. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   Where did you go for them, Volantis? 
           Podrick offers the figs to Olenna.  Olenna takes a fig and eats.

                   Oh, very well.  I won't have it said     
                   that House Tyrell refuses to play its 
                   part.  We'll pay for half the expenses 
                   and the celebrations will go on as 
                   planned. 
           Olenna stands up. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   Is that sufficient? 
           Tyrion puts his cup on the table and stands up. 
            
      01:19:00 
                          TYRION 
                   Quite sufficient.  Thank you. 
      01:19:01 
                          OLENNA 
                   Very good, then. That's settled.  Good 
                   day. 
           Olenna walks away.  Tyrion watches her as she leaves.  Podrick 
           moves closer to Tyrion with the plate of figs. 
            
      01:19:07 
                          TYRION 
                   Give me that. 
           Tyrion takes a fig and eats.

                   Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering 
                   every day if I'd get tortured or 
                   killed.  I'm done serving. 
      01:20:00      
                          ARYA 
                   You just said you were serving Lord 
                   Beric.

                          GENDRY 
                   He may be their leader, but they chose 
                   him.  These men are brothers.  They're 
                   a family. 
           Arya walks away. 
                          GENDRY (CONT'D) 
                   I've never had a family. 
           Arya stops and looks back at Gendry. 
            
      01:20:16 
                          ARYA 
                   I can be your family. 
      01:20:21      
                          GENDRY 
                   You wouldn't be my family.  You'd be 
                   "My lady." 
           Arya walks away.

                   Willem! 
           A man kicks the door open and enters.  Another man stabs him 
           from the back.  The man with a sword enters the dungeon with 
           Lord Rickard Karstark.  Willem sits up. 
            
      01:20:54

           Rickard grabs Willem out of the room.

                   ...I didn't do anything. 
           Karstark grabs Tion by the shirt. 
                          TION (CONT'D) 
                   I'm just a squire. 
           Karstark stabs Tion.

           Robb, Edmure and The Blackfish are standing in front of Willem 
           and Tion's dead bodies.  Talisa is kneeling beside the dead 
           bodies and Catelyn is sitting on the couch near by. 
            
      01:21:14 
                          ROBB 
                   Bring them in. 
           The man walks to the door and opens it.  Karstark and his men 
           walk inside the room escorted by soldiers. 
                          ROBB (CONT'D) 
                   Is that all of them?  It took five of 
                   you to murder two unarmed squires? 
      01:21:38

                          KARSTARK 
                   Was strangled by the Kingslayer.  They 
                   were his kin.

                          ROBB 
                   They were boys!  Look at them.

                          KARSTARK 
                   Tell your mother to look at them. 
                    
                          KARSTARK (CONT'D - OS) 
                   She killed them as much as I. 
      01:22:04 
                          ROBB 
                   My mother had nothing to do with this.  
                   This was your treason. 
      01:22:08 
                          KARSTARK 
                   It's treason to free your enemies. 
                    
                          KARSTARK (CONT'D - OS)

           Karstark stands up.

           The soldiers pulls Karstark and his men towards the door. 
                          MAN 6 (CONT'D - OS) 
                   I didn't kill anyone.  I only watched

           Robb sits on his chair.  Talisa and Edmure follow him and stand

                   Word of this can't leave Riverrun.

                   The blood of the First Men flows 
                   through my veins as much as yours, boy.  
                   I fought the Mad King for your father.  
                   I fought Joffrey for you.  We are kin--

                   I don't want it to save me.  I want it

                   Kill me and be cursed.  You are no king 
                   of mine. 
           Robb swings his sword, cutting Karstark's head off.

                   Lance right through the chest.

                          THOROS 
                   Then it was an arrow in the back. 
                    
                          THOROS (CONT'D - OS) 
                   And that axe in the side.

                          BERIC 
                   Then the Lannisters caught me and 
                   executed me for treason.  Was it a 
                   hanging or a...

                   Both.  Fuckers couldn't decide.

                   I know of your troubles, my king.  The 
      01:29:37     Lady Melisandre has told me everything. 
                          STANNIS 
                   Yes, of course. 
           Stannis walks to the window. 
                    
                          STANNIS (CONT'D) 
      01:29:47     (sighs) 
                          SELYSE (OS) 
                   You mustn't despair. 
                    
                          SELYSE (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Your claim... 
                    
                          SELYSE (CONT'D) 
                   ...is true.  You will be victorious. 
      01:29:52      
                          STANNIS 
                   I believed that once. 
      01:29:54      
                          SELYSE 
                   You are the one god's champion and the 
                   finest man I've ever known. 
      01:29:59      
                          STANNIS 
                   Selyse.  I've broken a sacred vow.  
                   I've sinned. 
      01:30:11      
                          SELYSE 
                   No. 
           Selyse slowly moves closer to Stannis.

                   I've wronged you.  I have shamed you.

                   You're doing god's... 
           Stannis shakes his head. 
                          SELYSE (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...work.

                          STANNIS 
                   You don't understand.  The Red Woman--
                   the Lady Melisandre... 
      01:30:30      
                          SELYSE 
                   I know, Stannis. 
      [MUSIC IN]    
                          SELYSE (CONT'D) 
                   The Lady Melisandre has told me 
                   everything.  No act done in service of 
                   the Lord of Light can ever be a sin.  
                   When she told me, I wept with joy. 
           Selyse walks past Stannis to three glass jars with stillborn 
           fetuses in each. 
                          SELYSE (CONT'D) 
                   Oh, my sweet boys. 
                          SELYSE (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Petyr... 
           Stannis closes his eyes and shakes his head. 
                          SELYSE (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...Tommard, Edric.

                          SELYSE (CONT'D - OS) 
                   I thank god every day for bringing 
                   Melisandre to us. 
                    
                          SELYSE (CONT'D) 
                   She gave you a son.

                          SELYSE (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...nothing. 
      01:31:28      
                          STANNIS 
                   That's not true. 
      01:31:34      
                          SELYSE 
                   So you've come to see her as well?  
                   There is no need.  You must keep away 
                   from such distractions. 
      01:31:45      
                          STANNIS 
                   She's my daughter. 
           Stannis turns to Selyse. 
                          STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   I want to see her. 
      01:31:53      
                          SELYSE 
                   You are a king.  You don't need my 
                   permission.

                   The second.  Thoros of Myr went in       
                   alone, waving that flaming sword of

                   Thoros of Myr.  Bloody madman.  Robert

                          JORAH 
                   Proudest moment of my life.  One knee 
                   in the dust, the king's sword on my 
                   shoulder, listening to the words.  "In 
                   the name of the Warrior, I charge you 
                   to be brave."  All I could think of was

                   Never occurred to me till the fighting 
                   was over. 
           Jorah and Barristan are walking, holding the leash of their 
           horses, and leading them along the desert.

                   He was a good man, a great warrior.  
                   And a terrible king.  I burned away my 
                   years fighting for terrible kings.

                   Yes.  And a man of honor keeps his 
                   vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a 
                   lunatic.  Just once in my life before 
                   it's over, I want to know what it's 
                   like to serve with pride, to fight for 
                   someone I believe in.  Do you believe

                   But Grey Worm is the name this one had 
                   the day Daenerys Stormborn set him 
                   free. 
      01:45:13      
                          JORAH (VO) 
                   King Robert wanted her dead. 
      01:45:15      
                          BARRISTAN (VO) 
                   Of course he... 
           Jorah and Barristan are walking, leading their horses along the 
           road.  Other soldiers are walking along the road with them. 
                          BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                   ...wanted her dead.  She's a Targaryen.  
                   The last Targaryen. 
      01:45:20      
                          JORAH 
                   I suppose no one on the Small Council 
                   could speak sense to him. 
      01:45:22      
                          BARRISTAN 
                   I didn't sit on the Small Council. 
           Jorah and Barristan stop walking. 
            
      01:45:24 
                          JORAH 
                   No?  Doesn't the Lord Commander of the 
                   Kingsguard traditionally... 
      01:45:27      
                          BARRISTAN (OS) 
                   Traditionally, yes, but...

                   I killed a dozen of Robert's friends     
                   during his rebellion. 
           Barristan and Jorah get on their horses. 
                          BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                   He didn't want advice on how to govern 
                   from a man who had fought for the Mad 
                   King. 
           Jorah and Barristan ride their horses along the road. 
                          BARRISTAN (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Can't say I minded much. 
                          BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                   I always hated the politics. 
      01:45:43      
                          JORAH 
                   Yeah, I imagine I would, too.  Hours 
                   spent jabbering about backstabbings and 
                   betrayals the world over. 
      01:45:49      
                          BARRISTAN 
                   Mm-hmm. 
      01:45:54      
                          JORAH 
                   Still, she'll have to wade through that 
                   muck if she wants to rule the Seven 
                   Kingdoms. 
      01:45:58      
                          BARRISTAN 
                   She'll have good men around her to 
                   advise her, men with experience. 
      01:46:01      
                          JORAH 
                   Which men do you have in mind?

      01:46:03 
                          BARRISTAN (OS) 
                   Forgive me, Ser Jorah... 
                    
                          BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                   ...for what I'm about to say, but your 
                   reputation in Westeros has suffered 
                   over the years. 
      01:46:09      
                          JORAH 
                   It suffered for a reason.  I sold men 
                   into slavery. 
      01:46:13      
                          BARRISTAN 
                   I don't know if your presence by her 
                   side will help our cause when we go 
                   home. 
      01:46:17      
                          JORAH 
                   Our cause?  Forgive me, Ser Barristan, 
                   but I was busy defending the Khaleesi 
                   against King Robert's assassins while 
                   you were still bowing to the man. 
      01:46:25      
                          BARRISTAN 
                   We both want her to rule.  Am I wrong? 
           Jorah and Barristan stop their horses. 
            
      01:46:29 
                          JORAH 
                   You only joined us a few days ago.  I 
                   can't speak to your intentions. 
      01:46:32

                   If we're truly her loyal servants, we 
                   will do whatever needs to be done, no 
                   matter the cost... 
                    
                          BARRISTAN (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...no matter our pride. 
      01:46:40      
                          JORAH 
                   You're not Lord Commander here.  You're 
                   just another exile.  And I take my 
                   orders from the queen. 
           Jorah rides his horse on the road, leaving Barristan behind. 
            
           INT. RIVERRUN – ROBB'S CHAMBER – DAY. 
            
           Robb is standing at the table while staring at the map with 
           figurines on it. 
            
      01:46:56 
                          TALISA (OS) 
                   Come to bed.  
      01:46:57      
                          ROBB 
                   You were right. 
           Robb grabs one of the figurines. 
                          ROBB (CONT'D) 
                   The Karstarks are gone. 
           Robb forcefully drops the figurine on the floor.  Talisa is 
           standing at the door. 
                          ROBB (CONT'D-OS) 
                   Almost half our forces.  Tywin 
                   Lannister knows what he needs to do to 
                   make us unravel. 
           Talisa walks towards Robb.

                          ROBB (CONT'D) 
                   Nothing.  Only wait. 
           Talisa stands across the table from Robb. 
            
      01:47:14 
                          TALISA 
                   Don't let him. 
      01:47:16      
                          ROBB 
                   What can I do?  Attack King's Landing?  
                   There's nothing he'd like better.  He'd 
                   crush us in a day. 
      01:47:25      
                          TALISA 
                   We could ride north. 
                    
                          TALISA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Take your land back from the Greyjoys.  
                   Wait out the winter. 
           Talisa moves closer to Robb and stands beside him. 
            
      01:47:30 
                          ROBB 
                   Winter could last five years.  Once my 
                   bannermen are home again, sitting by 
                   the fire, surrounded by their families, 
                   warm and safe, they'll never ride south 
                   again.  When I gathered my lords 
                   together, we had a purpose, a mission.  
                   Now we're like a band of bickering 
                   children. 
      01:47:48      
                          TALISA 
                   Give them a new purpose.

                          ROBB 
                   What? 
      01:47:54      
                          TALISA 
                   Oh, I don't know.  I don't even know 
                   where Winterfell is. 
      01:48:01      
                          ROBB 
                   Here. 
           Robb holds Talisa's hand and points at something on the map. 
                          ROBB (CONT'D) 
                   And we're here.  King's Landing... 
      [MUSIC IN]    
            
           Robb lets go of Talisa's hand and move to the other side of her. 
      01:48:17 
                          TALISA 
                   What is it? 
      01:48:22      
                          ROBB 
                   I can't force them to meet us in the 
                   field and I can't attack them where 
                   they're strongest, but I can attack 
                   them where they're not. 
           Robb takes a figurine from the table and moves it to another 
           spot. 
                          ROBB (CONT'D) 
                   And Casterly Rock can't run away. 
           Robb takes a figurine from the table.

                   I'm going to take their home away from   
                   them. 
      01:48:40      
                          TALISA 
                   Can you do it? 
      01:48:42      
                          ROBB 
                   I need men to replace the Karstarks who 
                   marched home.  There is only one person 
                   in this kingdom with that kind of army 
                   who hasn't already sided with the 
                   Lannisters.  The man whose daughter I 
                   was supposed to marry--Walder Frey. 
           Robb moves another figurine on the table. 
            
           INT. KING'S LANDING – GARDEN – DAY. 
            
           Loras and a soldier are fencing.  Sansa and Margaery watch them 
           at a table. 
            
      01:49:07 
                          SANSA 
                   He's such a splendid fighter.  Do you 
                   have any idea when we might... 
      01:49:13      
                          MARGAERY 
                   I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey 
                   and I are married.  It should grow 
                   quickly. 
      01:49:17      
                          SANSA 
                   Joffrey won't let me leave.  He's got 
                   too many reasons to keep me here.

                          MARGAERY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...to let you go.

                   Squire! 
           Olyver rushes to Loras with a glass of water.  Loras takes his 
           helmet off.  Olyver offers the glass of water to Loras. 
            
      01:49:32 
                          OLYVER 
                   Well fought, ser. 
           Loras takes the glass from Olyver. 
            
      01:49:35 
                          LORAS 
                   That was no fight.  I don't know you. 
           Olyver fixes Loras' vest. 
            
      01:49:38 
                          OLYVER 
                   Olyver, if it please you.  I should 
                   like to see you spar with a proper 
                   partner, ser. 
      01:49:44

           Olyver and Loras look at each other. 
                          LORAS (CONT'D) 
                   How did you know? 
      01:49:55      
                          OLYVER 
                   Know what? 
      01:49:58      
                          LORAS 
                   That I wanted to. 
      01:50:00      
                          OLYVER 
                   My lord... 
           Olyver gets off the bed and walks to a table.  Loras sits up on 
           his bed. 
            
      01:50:06 
                          LORAS 
                   I'll have you know I'm to be married 
                   soon and even my intended... 
                    
                          LORAS (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...hasn't the slightest notion. 
           Olyver takes a pitcher at the table and pours drink into a 
           glass. 
            
      01:50:11 
                          OLYVER 
                   They rarely do, in my experience. 
           Loras stands up, walks towards Olyver and caresses him as he 
           drinks from the glass.

                   You have a good deal of experience, do 
                   you? 
           Olyver puts the glass back on the table. 
            
      01:50:17 
                          OLYVER 
                   With the husbands. 
           Olyver turns to Loras and they continue kissing as they move 
           back to the bed.

           Littlefinger walks to the sofa with a glass of water. 
            
      01:50:28 
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   That didn't take long. 
      01:50:31      
                          OLYVER (OS) 
                   Well, it... 
                    
           Littlefinger sits beside Olyver on the sofa. 
                          OLYVER (CONT'D) 
                   ...took long enough.  It seems our 
                   Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.

                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   Is he?  And...who's the lucky girl? 
           INT. KING'S LANDING – DAY. 
            
           Sansa is looking at the ship on the ocean.

                   She may not be... 
           Sansa looks back at Littlefinger. 
                          LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...the grandest ship in the world... 
           Littlefinger moves closer to Sansa. 
                          LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                   ...or the fastest, but she's mine. 
           Sansa and Littlefinger sit at a bench. 
                          LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                   I've always wanted a ship.  Now I want 
                   a dozen.  Strange, isn't it? 
      01:51:01      
                          SANSA 
                   What is? 
      01:51:02      
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   It doesn't matter what we want, once we 
                   get it, then we want something else.  
                   Your hair is different.

                          SANSA 
                   Is it? 
      01:51:15      
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   Lady Margaery wears it that way. 
      01:51:16      
                          SANSA 
                   Many ladies wear it this way.

                   I have good news.  I'll be leaving the 
                   city soon.

                          SANSA 
                   You still want me to come with you? 
      01:51:24      
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   It's not a question of what I want.  
                   It's what you want.  You want to go 
                   home, don't you? 
      01:51:30      
                          SANSA 
                   Of course.  More than anything.  But 
                   maybe it would be better to wait.  I've 
                   been thinking how dangerous it would 
                   be.  Not just for me, but for you.  
                   You've been so kind.  I'd feel terrible 
                   if anything happened to you. 
      01:51:49      
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   I can't tell you how touched I am by 
                   your concern for my welfare.  I hope 
                   you know that I'm your friend, Sansa.  
                   Your true friend.

                   I bring them into the royal fold and 
                   this is how they repay me, by trying to 
                   steal the key to the North out from

                   Sansa is the key to the North?  I seem 
                   to remember she has an older brother.

                   The Karstarks have marched home.  The 
                   young wolf has lost half his army.  His 
                   days are numbered.

                   Theon Greyjoy murdered both his 
                   brothers.
