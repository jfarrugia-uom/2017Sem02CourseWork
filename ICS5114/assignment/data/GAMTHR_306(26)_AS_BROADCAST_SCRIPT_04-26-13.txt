                   Huh.  You know your fires.

                   Oh, I found something at the Fist of 
                   the First Men. 
           Sam pulls out a dragonglass dagger from his coat. 
                          SAM (CONT'D) 
                   Buried treasure.  Thousands of years

                          SAM 
                   Bigger.  So big you can't even see the 
                   top sometimes.  It's hidden in clouds.

                   I'm not.  It's 700 feet high, all made 
                   of ice.  On a warm day you can see it 
                   weeping.  Castle Black is nice enough.  
                   They keep a fire burning in the long 
                   hall day and night.  And Hobb makes 
                   venison stew with onions.  Very tasty.  
                   Sometimes, one of the Brothers will 
                   sing.  Dareon sings best.

           Meera nods her head.  Jojen settles down.  Meera removes the 
           strap from his mouth.  Jojen sits up.

                   ...a mile of the Wall.

                   Crows would come out every morning with

                   Your flock gets smaller every year. 
           Orell walks away.  Ygritte pulls out a pair of crampons from her 
           bag.

                   No.  But Tormund's done it half a

                          YGRITTE (CONT'D) 
                   It's a long way up and a long way down.  
                   But I've waited my whole life to see 
                   the world from up there.  Here, sit 
                   down.  I brought a pair for you. 
           Ygritte throws the crampons to Jon Snow.  Jon Snow sits down and 
           picks them up. 
                          YGRITTE (CONT'D) 
                   They're too big for you, but they're 
                   good.

           Jon Snow ties on the crampons. 
                          YGRITTE (CONT'D - OS) 
                   I didn't kill him, but I bet his

           Ygritte moves closer to Jon Snow and helps him tie his crampons.

                   But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow.

                   live or die.  Mance Rayder don't care 
                   if I live or die.  We're just soldiers 
                   in their armies and there's plenty more 
                   to carry on if we go down.

                   'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right 
                   off and wear it 'round my neck. 
           Ygritte sees Tormund and turns her back to Jon Snow.  Tormund 
           walks towards Jon Snow.  He holds out an ice axe and pulls Jon 
           Snow up. 
            
      01:11:47 
                          TORMUND 
                   Sink your metal deep and make sure it 
                   holds before taking your next step.  
                   And if you fall, don't scream.  You 
                   don't want that to be the last thing... 
           Tormund tilts his head towards Ygritte. 
                          TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                   ...she remembers.  (laughs) 
           Tormund pats Jon Snow's shoulder.  He then picks up his bag. 
                          TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                   (grunts) 
           Tormund walks away.  Ygritte looks at Jon Snow.

           An arrow hits a straw man on the face.

           Arya pulls on her bow. 
                          ARYA (CONT'D) 
                   (breathes) 
           Arya releases the arrow.  The arrow hits the chest of the straw 
           man. 
                          ARYA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Cersei.

           Arya shoots another arrow and hits the groin of the straw man.

           Anguy sits on the tree stump behind Arya while observing her.  
           Thoros is lying next to a tree stump. 
            
      01:12:24 
                          ANGUY 
                   You're good. 
           Anguy moves closer to Arya. 
                          ANGUY (CONT'D) 
                   You're not as good as you think you 
                   are. 
           Anguy steps back and crosses his arms. 
            
      01:12:35 
                          ARYA

                          ARYA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...tits, balls... 
                    
                          ARYA (CONT'D) 
                   I hit 'em right where I wanted to. 
      01:12:39      
                          ANGUY 
                   Aye... 
           Thoros looks at them. 
                          ANGUY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...but you took your sweet time of it. 
                    
                          ANGUY (CONT'D) 
                   You won't be fighting straw men, little 
                   lady.  Show me your position. 
           Arya pulls on her bow.  Anguy fixes Arya's posture. 
                             16                       04/26/2013

                   Keep your elbow high.  You want your 
                   back doing the hard labor. 
                    
                          ANGUY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   You're holding. 
           Anguy shakes his head. 
                          ANGUY (CONT'D) 
                   Never hold. 
           Arya lowers the bow. 
            
      01:13:04 
                          ARYA 
                   What? 
           Anguy mimics pulling a bow. 
            
      01:13:05 
                          ANGUY 
                   Your muscles tense up when you hold. 
           Anguy mimics the proper way to pull a bow. 
                          ANGUY (CONT'D) 
                   Pull the string back to the center of 
                   your chin and release.  Never hold. 
      01:13:12      
                          ARYA 
                   But I have to aim. 
      01:13:13      
                          ANGUY 
                   (chuckles) 
           Anguy walks behind Arya. 
                          ANGUY (CONT'D) 
                   Never aim.

                          ARYA 
                   Never aim? 
           Anguy leans over to Arya. 
            
      01:13:19 
                          ANGUY 
                   Your eye knows where it wants the arrow 
                   to go.  Trust your eye. 
           Anguy steps back and crosses his arms. 
            
      01:13:25 
                          ARYA 
                   (breathes deeply) 
           Arya pulls on the bow and sees Melisandre's men on horseback in 
           the woods. 
                          ARYA (CONT'D) 
                   There's someone out there. 
      [MUSIC IN]    
           Anguy moves closer to Arya and takes the bow from her.  He then 
           walks towards the convoy.  Thoros sits up.  The Brotherhood 
           Without Banners and Arya walk towards the convoy.  Anguy aims 
           his bow at the newcomers. 
            
      01:13:48 
                          ANGUY 
                   That's about far enough. 
           The Brotherhood Without Banners line up behind Anguy.  
           Melisandre lifts her hood to reveal her face. 
            
      01:13:56 
                          MELISANDRE

           Beric is sitting by the campfire.  He then turns around and sees 
           Thoros holding a torch with Melisandre standing next to him.  
           Melisandre removes her hood.  Beric stands up.

           Melisandre moves closer to Beric.  Thoros extinguishes the

           Melisandre turns to Thoros.  Thoros sits down. 
                          THOROS (CONT'D) 
                   I've always been a terrible priest.  
                   Drank too much rum.  Fucked all the 
                   whores in King's Landing.  It's a 
                   terrible thing to say, but by the time 
                   I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in 
                   our Lord.

                          THOROS (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...that all the gods, were stories we 
                   told the children to make them behave. 
                    
                          THOROS (CONT'D) 
                   So I wore the robes and every now and 
                   then I'd recite the prayers, but it was 
                   just for show.  A spectacle for the

           Thoros points at Beric.

           Jon Snow is climbing behind Ygritte.

                          JON SNOW 
                   (breathes heavily) 
           Jon Snow looks down the Wall.  He is seized by vertigo.  He then 
           looks up at Ygritte. 
            
      01:21:35 
                          YGRITTE 
                   (breaths heavily) 
           Ygritte looks down at Jon Snow.  Jon Snow smiles at her. 
                          YGRITTE (CONT'D) 
                   You staring at my ass, Jon Snow? 
           Tormund accidentally hits loose a slab of ice. 
            
      01:21:44 
                          TORMUND 
                   Look out! 
           Orell evades the falling ice. 
            
      01:21:45 
                          ORELL 
                   (grunts) 
      01:21:46      
                          YGRITTE 
                   (grunts) 
           A large chunk of ice hits Jon Snow's head.

                          JON SNOW 
                   (grunts) 
           Jon Snow loses his balance and falls causing the piton to come 
           loose.  The next piton holds and Jon Snow then drives his ice 
           axe into the wall to stop himself from falling. 
            
      01:21:52 
                          YGRITTE (to Jon Snow) 
                   You all right? 
           Jon Snow continues to climb. 
            
      01:21:55 
                          JON SNOW

                          TORMUND (OS) 
                   Just seeing... 
                    
                          TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                   ...if you can take a hit, lad. 
                    
                          TORMUND (CONT'D - OS) 
                   (laughing) 
           The Wildlings continue to climb. 
            
           INT. DUNGEON - DAY. 
            
           Boy is blowing a trumpet while seated at a chair.  Theon wakes 
           up.  He is tied to a cross. 
            
      01:22:08

                          BOY 
                   Sorry.  Were you sleeping?

                   Wa... 
      01:22:20      
                          BOY 
                   Wa--?  Wa--? 
           Boy points at the cup on the table. 
                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   Water?  You want some water. 
           Boy picks up the cup. 
                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   I wish I had some for you. 
           Boy deliberately pours the water on the ground.  Theon looks at 
           it longingly. 
            
      01:22:36 
                          THEON 
                   (whimpering) 
           Boy stands up and walks towards Theon. 
            
      01:22:47 
                          BOY

                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   Which body part do you need the least? 
      01:22:56      
                          THEON 
                   Please.

                          BOY 
                   Please is not a body part. 
      01:22:59      
                          THEON 
                   I'll tell you everything, please. 
      01:23:02      
                          BOY 
                   But you've already told me everything. 
                    
                          BOY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Remember? 
                    
                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   Your daddy was mean to you.  The Starks 
                   didn't appreciate you.  One good bit, 
                   though. 
           Boy leans closer to Theon. 
                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   The Stark boys, they're still alive.  
                   Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember?  
                   You failed, but... 
           Boy touches Theon's chest with his finger. 
                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   ...I'm a better hunter than you. 
                    
                          BOY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Now... 
           Boy holds up his little finger. 
                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   ...how about your little finger? 
                    
                          BOY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   You don't use that for much, do you? 
                    
                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   No?  Good.  Let's start with that. 
                             32                       04/26/2013

           Boy adjusts the straps on Theon's right arm. 
            
      01:23:47 
                          THEON 
                   (groans) 
      01:23:53      
                          BOY 
                   You've been wondering why you're here. 
                    
                          BOY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Haven't you?  Where you are. 
                    
                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   Who I am.  Why I'm doing this to you.  
                   So guess. 
                    
                          BOY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   If you guess right... 
                    
                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   ...I'll tell you.  By the old gods and 
                   the new, I swear it.  You win the 
                   game... 
           Boy walks to the front of Theon. 
                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   ...if you can figure out who I am and 
                   why I'm torturing you and I win the 
                   game if you beg me to cut off your 
                   finger. 
      01:24:28      
                          THEON 
                   If I win, you'll let me go? 
           Boy leans closer to Theon. 
            
      01:24:34 
                          BOY 
                   If you think this has a happy ending, 
                   you haven't been paying attention. 
                             33                       04/26/2013

                          BOY 
                   You say please again... 
           Boy pulls out a knife and points it at Theon. 
                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   ...and you'll wish you hadn't.  You 
                   first.  Where are we? 
      01:24:54      
                          THEON 
                   The North.

                          BOY 
                   Too vague.

                   (laughing) Terrible guess. 
           Boy slices off the tip of Theon's little finger. 
            
      01:25:05 
                          THEON

                          BOY 
                   Do I look like a fucking Umber to you? 
           Boy sticks the knife in Theon's finger. 
            
      01:25:20 
                          THEON

                          BOY (CONT'D - OS)

                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   Did you see any banners flying when we 
                   came in? 
      01:25:42      
                          THEON 
                   No.  It was just a guess. 
      01:25:47      
                          BOY 
                   Very good, Lord Theon.  And who am I?

                   He was your brother.  Your father is 
                   Lord Rickard Karstark. 
           Boy walks back to his chair and sits down. 
                          THEON (CONT'D) 
                   You swore to tell me if I... 
      01:26:25      
                          BOY 
                   You're right. 
      01:26:28      
                          THEON 
                   Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's 
                   bannerman. 
                    
                          THEON (CONT'D - OS) 
                   I betrayed Robb. 
                    
                          THEON (CONT'D) 
                   That's why you're torturing me. 
      01:26:40      
                          BOY 
                   Yes.  You win. 
           Boy plays with the knife and stands abruptly. 
                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   Of course...

           Boy moves closer to Theon.

                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   ...you forgot to ask one question.  You 
                   forgot to ask if I'm a liar. 
           Boy slips the knife into Theon's finger. 
            
      01:27:07

                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   ...I am. 
           Boy pulls on Theon's finger.

           Boy peels back the skin. 
                          BOY (CONT'D) 
                   ...I enjoy it. 
           Theon struggles in pain. 
            
      01:27:27

                   it off!  (screaming) 
           Boy walks to the front of Theon.

           INT. RIVERRUN CASTLE - MEETING CHAMBER - DAY. 
            
           Blackfish, Edmure, Robb, Catelyn, Lothar and Black Walder are 
           seated at a table. 
            
      01:27:38 
                          ROBB 
                   Thank you for riding here so quickly.  
                   I know travel isn't easy in these 
                   times. 
      01:27:43      
                          BLACK WALDER 
                   The roads are crawling with cutthroats 
                   and bandits.  But when the King of the 
                   North summons us, we come. 
      01:27:49      
                          LOTHAR (OS) 
                   Our father has instructed us to tell 
                   you that his alliance...

                          ROBB 
                   Of course.  He deserves as much.  I was 
                   in the wrong. 
      01:28:07      
                          BLACK WALDER 
                   As restitution for this betrayal... 
                    
                          BLACK WALDER (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...he demands Harrenhal and all its 
                   attendant lands.

                   I don't think that's...

                   We are... 
                    
                          ROBB (CONT'D) 
                   ...fighting for the North.  Harrenhal 
                   is not in the North.  It is his once 
                   the war is over and we have no further 
                   strategic need for it. 
      01:28:26      
                          BLACK WALDER 
                   And there's something else.

                   We will do... 
                    
                          ROBB (CONT'D) 
                   ...whatever we can to give Lord Frey

                   Not what... 
           Black Walder looks at Edmure. 
                          BLACK WALDER (CONT'D) 
                   ...whom. 
           Blackfish looks at Edmure. 
            
      01:28:38 
                          EDMURE 
                   What? 
           Robb, Catelyn and Lothar all look at Edmure. 
                          EDMURE (CONT'D) 
                   (chuckles) No. 
      01:28:46      
                          LOTHAR 
                   Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed

                          EDMURE 
                   Could I see her first? 
      01:28:54      
                          BLACK WALDER (OS) 
                   You want to count...

      01:29:08      
                          LOTHAR 
                   Father is old.  It will put his heart 
                   at peace if he could see her wed to a 
                   good husband. 
      01:29:15      
                          BLACK WALDER 
                   And his recent experience... 
                    
                             41                       04/26/2013

                          ROBB 
                   He has every right to be.  Please 
                   excuse us while we discuss it. 
           Black Walder stands up and walks towards the door.  Lothar limps 
           after him.  Catelyn, Robb, Edmure and Blackfish watch them walk 
           away.  Blackfish drinks from his cup.  The guards close the 
           door. 
            
      01:29:42 
                          EDMURE (to Robb) 
                   Why should I let that old ferret choose 
                   my bride for me?  At the very least, I 
                   should be offered the same... 
           Edmure stands. 
                          EDMURE (CONT'D) 
                   ...choice you were. 
           Edmure walks towards the window. 
                          EDMURE (CONT'D) 
                   I'm his liege lord. 
      01:29:50      
                          ROBB 
                   He's a proud man and we've wounded him. 
      01:29:52      
                          EDMURE 
                   I didn't wound him.  My answer is no. 
           Blackfish stands and approaches Edmure. 
            
      01:30:00 
                          BLACKFISH

                   Listen to me and listen very carefully. 
           Blackfish points at Edmure. 
                          BLACKFISH (CONT'D) 
                   You... 
      01:30:04      
                          EDMURE 
                   The laws of gods and men are very 
                   clear.  No man can compel another man 
                   to marry.

                   ...the most beautiful woman in all 
                   seven kingdoms... 
           Tywin takes the cups and walks over to Olenna.  He then hands 
           one of the cups to Olenna. 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   ...and the mother of the king. 
      01:33:59      
                          OLENNA 
                   Old. 
           Olenna takes a sip.  Tywin walks towards his chair and stops 
           short. 
            
      01:34:02 
                          TYWIN 
                   Old? 
      01:34:04      
                          OLENNA 
                   Old.

                          OLENNA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   I'm something of an expert on the 
                   subject. 
           Tywin continues walking towards his chair. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Her change will be upon her before 
                   long. 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   I'll spare you the details... 
           Tywin sits across from Olenna. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   ...of what will happen then.  You men 
                   may have a stomach for bloodshed and 
                   slaughter, but this is another 
                   matter... 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...entirely. 
      01:34:20      
                          TYWIN 
                   The years punish us as well, I promise 
                   you that. 
           Tywin drinks from his cup. 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   My stomach remains quite strong, 
                   however.  The only thing that might 
                   turn it are details of your grandson's 
                   nocturnal activities. 
                    
                          TYWIN (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Do you deny them? 
      01:34:37      
                          OLENNA 
                   Oh, not at all.  A sword swallower 
                   through and through. 
                    
                             51                       04/26/2013

                          TYWIN 
                   And a boy with his affliction should be 
                   grateful for the opportunity... 
                    
                          TYWIN (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...to marry the most beautiful woman in 
                   the kingdoms and remove... 
                    
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   ...the stain from his name. 
           Tywin takes another drink from his cup. 
            
      01:34:49 
                          OLENNA (OS) 
                   Did you grow up... 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   ...with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?  Sons 
                   of your father's bannermen, squires, 
                   stable boys? 
      01:34:57      
                          TYWIN 
                   Of course. 
      01:34:59      
                          OLENNA 
                   And you never... 
      01:35:03      
                          TYWIN 
                   No. 
      01:35:05      
                          OLENNA 
                   Not once?  Not in any way? 
      01:35:08      
       
                             52                       04/26/2013

                          TYWIN 
                   Never. 
           Tywin drinks from his cup. 
            
      01:35:10 
                          OLENNA (OS) 
                   I congratulate... 
           Olenna raises her cup to Tywin. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   ...you upon your restraint.  But it's a 
                   natural thing, two boys having a go at 
                   each other beneath the sheets. 
      01:35:16      
                          TYWIN 
                   Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance 
                   for unnatural behavior. 
      01:35:21      
                          OLENNA (OS) 
                   I wouldn't say that. 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   True, we don't tie ourselves in knots 
                   over a discreet bit of buggery, 
                   but...brothers and sisters--where I 
                   come from, that stain would be very 
                   difficult to wash out. 
      01:35:38      
                          TYWIN 
                   I will not breathe further life into a 
                   malicious lie by discussing it. 
           Tywin stands up and pours himself another drink. 
            
      01:35:45 
                          OLENNA 
                   Lie or not, you must admit many... 
                             53                       04/26/2013

           Tywin takes the pitcher from the table. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   ...people find it quite convincing. 
           Tywin pours wine into his cup. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   Convincing enough to put swords in 
                   their hands and send them off to kill 
                   Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our 
                   new affiliation. 
           Tywin walks towards Olenna holding the pitcher. 
            
      01:35:58 
                          TYWIN 
                   I don't care what people believe. 
           Tywin offers her some wine and she declines. 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   And neither do you. 
           Tywin turns away. 
            
      01:36:02 
                          OLENNA 
                   (chuckles) As an authority on myself, I 
                   must disagree. 
           Tywin puts the pitcher back.  He then walks back to Olenna. 
            
      01:36:07 
                          TYWIN 
                   Now, if the rumors about my children 
                   were true, then Joffrey is no king at 
                   all and House Tyrell is throwing its 
                   prized flower into the dirt. 
      01:36:18

                   And if Cersei is too old to give Loras 
                   children... 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...we're throwing another prized... 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   ...flower into the dirt.  It is a 
                   chance we simply cannot... 
                    
                          OLENNA (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...take. 
      01:36:29      
                          TYWIN 
                   The uncertainty makes you 
                   uncomfortable.  All right. 
           Tywin walks towards his chair and sets his cup down. 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   I'll remove it for you.  If you refuse 
                   to marry Loras to Cersei... 
           Tywin sits down. 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   ...I will name him to the Kingsguard. 
                    
                          TYWIN (CONT'D - OS) 
                   I'm sure you're familiar with the 
                   Kingsguard vows. 
                    
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   He will never marry.  He will never 
                   have children. 
      01:36:50      
                          OLENNA 
                   Oh... 
      01:36:50      
                          TYWIN (OS) 
                   The Tyrell name will fade. 
                             55                       04/26/2013

                   And Highgarden will go to the children 
                   of Joffrey and Margaery. 
      01:36:57      
                          OLENNA 
                   You would have your grandson protected 
                   by someone who disgusts you? 
      01:37:01      
                          TYWIN 
                   I would have my grandson protected by a 
                   skilled warrior who takes his vows 
                   seriously. 
           Tywin picks up a quill. 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   So, shall I draw up... 
           Tywin dips the quill in ink. 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   ...the order?  Or do you consent to 
                   this marriage? 
           Olenna sets her cup down and stands up. 
            
      01:37:20 
                          OLENNA 
                   It's a rare enough thing--a man... 
           Olenna takes the quill from Tywin's hand. 
                          OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                   ...who lives up to his reputation. 
           Olenna breaks the quill. 
            
           INT. THE WALL - NIGHT. 
            
           The Wildlings and Jon Snow are climbing the Wall.

           Ygritte swings her ice axe into the ice, breaking it.  The ice

                          LORAS 
                   Oh, it's more of a brooch, really.  
                   Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of 
                   pin, so... 
      01:40:24      
                          SANSA 
                   I'm very happy about... 
      01:40:28      
                          LORAS 
                   Uh, yes.  I-I am as well. 
      01:40:34      
                          SANSA 
                   I feel like I'm in a dream.  (chuckles)

                          LORAS 
                   Yes, me, too.  Definitely.  I've 
                   dreamed of a large wedding since I was 
                   quite young.  The guests, the food, the 
                   tournaments.  And the bride, of course.  
                   (chuckles) The most beautiful bride in 
                   the world in a beautiful gown of gold 
                   and green brocade with fringed sleeves.  
                   Have you ever been to Highgarden, my 
                   lady? 
      01:41:08      
                          SANSA 
                   No.  I had never left Winterfell before 
                   I came to King's Landing.  But it 
                   sounds wonderful.  I can't wait to see 
                   it.  And to leave this place.

                   It's hard to say which of the four of 
                   us is getting the worst of this 
                   arrangement.  Probably Sansa.  Though 
                   Loras will certainly come to know a 
                   deep and singular misery.
