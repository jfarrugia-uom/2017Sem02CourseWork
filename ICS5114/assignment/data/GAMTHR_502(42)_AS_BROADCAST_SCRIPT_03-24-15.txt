               Arya stares up at the Titan of Braavos. 
         01:02:02:05   BRAAVOSI CAPTAIN 
                        In the old times... 
               Arya and Braavosi Captain stand at the stern.

                      whenever Braavos stood in  
                       danger, the Titan would  
                       step with fire in his eyes. 
         01:02:09:22   BRAAVOSI CAPTAIN 
                       He'd wade into the sea  
                       and smash the enemies. 
         01:02:14:10

                [HORN BLOWS] 
                
               Arya clutches her chest.

                       (laughs) Don't be afraid.

               The ship sails towards the Titan of Braavos.

               [DOCK WALLA] 
                
               Arya watches merchants and others busy on the docks as 
               Braavosi Captain rows them through the port towards 
               the city.

               Braavosi Captain continues to pilot them through the 
               Canal of Heroes towards the center of Braavos. 
                
         01:03:25:17

               Braavosi Captain pilots Arya across the open water and 
               towards the House of Black and White in the distance.

               Braavosi Captain glances over his shoulder at the 
               approaching House of Black and White. 
         01:03:37:06   BRAAVOSI CAPTAIN 
                     The House of Black and White. 
          
         01:03:39:19   BRAAVOSI CAPTAIN 
                  This is where you'll find the man you seek. 
               Braavosi Captain pulls the boat up to the islet. He 
               steadies the boat against the islet. He helps Arya out of 
               the boat. She looks up at the closed doors of the House of 
               Black and White. 3 
          
                
         01:03:47:23   BRAAVOSI CAPTAIN 
                        Here I leave you. 
               Arya turns around to face Braavosi Captain. 
                
         01:03:57:21       ARYA 
                      Thank you for bringing me. 
         01:03:59:13         
                       BRAAVOSI CAPTAIN 
                 Any man of Braavos would have done the same. 
               He pushes off the dock and salutes Arya as the boat drifts 
               away. 
                
         01:04:04:10   BRAAVOSI CAPTAIN 
                        Valar morghulis.

                         Valar dohaeris. 
               Arya moves towards the doors to the House of Black and 
               White.

               Arya glances over her shoulder as Braavosi Captain rows 
               away. She moves forward to the doors. 
                
               Arya knocks. 
                
                [KNOCKS] 
                
               Arya looks around. 
                
               She knocks again. 
                
                [KNOCKS] 4 
          
                
               The door opens as she is about to knock again. An old 
               man in a hooded robe comes to the door. 
         01:04:42:25       ARYA 
                           Hello.

                           Um... 
               She holds up an iron coin.

               Arya stands and walks forward. She looks at the iron 
               coin in her hands. She tosses the coin into the water and 
               walks away.

                           Ale? 
               She fills his cup. He smiles up at her. She moves away to 
               another table.

               Podrick looks intently at Barmaid on the other side of 
               the tavern. 
                
               Across the tavern, Petyr picks through his food. Sansa 
               watches from across the table. 
         01:07:22:09       SANSA 
                       Before we left, a maester

                       My mother used to say,  
                      "Dark wings, dark words." 
         01:07:33:03       PETYR 
                    An old saying. Inaccurate in this case. 
                
               Podrick continues to stare at Barmaid. 
                
               Across the tavern, Barmaid passes between two men in 
               armor. 
                
         01:07:37:24      BARMAID

                       So it was good news? 
               Petyr sits looking across the table at Sansa. 
                
         01:07:41:14       PETYR 
                   My marriage proposal has been accepted.

                     Thought you still mourned the  
                     death of my beloved Aunt Lysa. 
               Barmaid approaches Petyr. 
                
         01:07:46:26      BARMAID 
                           Ale? 
               Peter gestures no. 
                
         01:07:48:15       SANSA 
                         I'll have some. 
               Podrick stares across the room over his drink. 
                
               Barmaid fills Sansa's cup. 
                
               Podrick puts down his cup.

               Bronn puts his arm around Lollys. They look at Castle 
               Stokeworth in the distance.

         01:17:40:04      LOLLYS 
                   We won't get to live at Stokeworth. When  
                  Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because  
                          she's older.

         01:18:00:12      LOLLYS 
                           She is.

                  I've been all over the world, and if there's one 
                   thing I've learned it's that meanness comes  
                  around. People like your sister, they always  
                  get what's coming to them eventually. One

                  this little visit could possibly mean anything

                       It's very good for you. 
               Jaime reaches inside his doublet and hands Bronn a 
               scroll. Bronn reads it.

               behind him. His dagger breaks through the soft wall.

               soldier drags the man away. 
                
               Grey Worm looks through a cache of weapons hidden in 
               the wall. Grey Worm uncovers a golden mask and looks

               Mossador looks pleadingly at Daenerys. She looks away. 
               Daario steps forward. 
                
               The crowd jeers angrily. The masters stand silently. 
                
               Daario readies his sword. Mossador looks at Daenerys.

                       (whispers in Valyrian) 
               Daenerys looks at Mossador, kneeling with his eyes 
               squeezed shut and Daario's blade against his neck. She 
               looks forward. Daario swings the blade. The city falls 
               silent.

               The crowd hisses. 
                
               The Unsullied crouch into defensive formation. Daario 
               looks around. A woman in the audience grabs a rock off 
               the ground.

               A man in the crowd throws a rock over a guard. A master 
               is hit in the head. Daario turns to look. The masters begin 
               to surge forward towards the Unsullied. 
                
               On the opposite side of the platform, former slaves surge 
               forward towards the Unsullied. 
                
               Elsewhere on the wall, former slaves and former masters 
               rush towards each other with Unsullied between. 
                
               Ser Barristan and Grey Worm usher Daenerys and 
               Missandei off the platform. Daario follows behind them.

               The crowd struggles. Unsullied flow down steps towards 
               the crowds. The crowds shake their fists and shout 
               against Unsullied holding them back. 
                
               A former master is struck in the face by a rock. 
               Daenerys and Missandei rush down stairs surrounded by 
               Unsullied. The Unsullied shield Daenerys and Missandei.  
               Daenerys and the Unsullied head away towards a tower. 
               Former slaves and former masters fight. 
               Unsullied block the crowd from following Daenerys. 
               Unsullied form a shield wall over Daenerys as the crowd 
               drops rocks on them from above.

               Barristan nods. Everyone exits, leaving Daenerys alone.

               Drogon climbs down the side of the pyramid towards 
               Daenerys. He stretches his head towards her. She slowly 
               reaches out for him. He sniffs her hand and backs away. 
                
               Drogon takes off. Daenerys watches him fly away.
