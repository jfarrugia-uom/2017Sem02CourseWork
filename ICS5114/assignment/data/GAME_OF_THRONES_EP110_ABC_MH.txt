               MOMENT.
                                    YOREN
                        Look at me. Look at me! Do you remember
                        me now, boy?  Eh? Remember me? There’s
                        a good boy. You’ll be going with me,
                        boy, and you’ll be keeping your mouth
                        shut.
               ARYA STARES INTO YOREN’S EYES, CONFUSED AND IN SHOCK. YOREN
               PICKS ARYA UP AND CARRIES HER SWIFTLY THROUGH THE CROWD.

                                    ARYA
                        I’m not a boy!

                   Not a smart boy, that what you’re trying
                   to say?Do you want to live, boy?
           YOREN GRABS ARYA’S HAIR AND BEGINS CHOPPING OFF LARGE CHUNKS OF
           IT WITH HIS DAGGER.
                            YOREN
                   North, boy. We’re going north.

           WS OF THREE-EYED RAVEN FLYING INTO WINTERFELL. IT LIGHTS ON A
           CART OF HAY NEAR BRAN, WHO IS PRACTICING HIS ARCHERY. THE
           RAVEN CAWS AT BRAN, WHO PUTS HIS BOW DOWN TO WATCH THE RAVEN.
           THE RAVEN FLIES ACROSS THE COURTYARD, TO LIGHT ON ONE OF THE
           DIREWOLF STATUES AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE CRYPT. BRAN FOLLOWS
           THE RAVEN.
           EXT. WINTERFELL – COURTYARD – DAY
           BRAN RIDES ON OSHA’S SHOULDERS THE NEXT MORNING, TOWARDS THE
           CRYPT ENTRANCE.
                            BRAN
                   It had three eyes. It told me to come
                   with him, so I did. We went down into
                   the crypts… and my father was there.
                            OSHA
                   Your father’s not down there, little
                   lord. Not for many years, yet.
                            BRAN
                   You’re afraid. Just like Hodor.
                            OSHA
                   I’m not ‘fraid of some hole in the
                   ground.
                            BRAN
                   You’ve lived beyond the Wall. What are
                   you scared of? I’m a crippled boy, and
                   I’m willing to go.
           INT. WINTERFELL – CRYPT – DAY
           OSHA CARRIES BRAN ON HER HIP. BRAN CARRIES A TORCH TO LIGHT
           THEIR WAY. BRAN EXPLAINS EACH OSSUARY AS THEY PASS.

                                    BRAN
                         That’s my grandfather, Lord Rickard. He
                         was burned alive by the Mad King Aerys.
               THEY STOP IN FRONT OF LYANNA STARK’S STATUE.
                                    BRAN
                         That’s Lyanna, my father’s sister. King
                         Robert was supposed to marry her, but
                         Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.Robert
                         started a war to win her back. He
                         killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.
               THEY CONTINUE WALKING, AND BRAN STARES INTO THE NEXT ALCOVE,
               WHICH IS EMPTY.
                                    BRAN
                         That’s where I saw father.
                                    OSHA
                         You see? He’s not here.
               A STRANGE NOISE FURTHER DOWN THE TUNNEL STARTLES THEM.
               RICKON’S DIREWOLF CHARGES OUT OF THE DARKNESS, SNARLING AND
               BARKING AT THEM. BRAN AND OSHA FALL TO THE GROUND, THE TORCH
               IN FRONT OF THEM. THE DIREWOLF STOPS AT THE EDGE OF THE
               TORCHLIGHT, SNARLING.
                                    RICKON
                         Here, Shaggydog.
               RICKON STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS, AND STANDS NEXT TO HIS
               DIREWOLF.
                                    BRAN
                         Rickon!
                                    OSHA
                         That beast is supposed to be chained in
                         the kennels!
                                    RICKON
                         He doesn’t like chains.
                                    BRAN
                         What are you doing down here? Come back
                         up with us.

                         No. I came to see father.
                                    BRAN
                         How many times have I told you? He’s in
                         King’s Landing, with Sansa and Arya.
                                    RICKON
                         He was down here. I saw him.
                                    BRAN
                         Saw him when?
                                    RICKON
                         Last night. When I was sleeping.
               RICKON TURNS BACK AND WALKS OFF INTO THE SHADOWS, WITH NO
               SOURCE OF LIGHT. HIS DIREWOLF FOLLOWS BEHIND.
                                    RICKON
                         Here, Shaggydog…
               EXT. WINTERFELL – COURTYARD (CRYPT ENTRANCE) – DAY
               OSHA CARRIES BRAN AWAY FROM THE CRYPT, ACROSS THE COURTYARD.
                                    OSHA
                         You both miss him. It’s only natural
                         that he should be in your thoughts and
                         dreams, but that doesn’t mean that…
               OSHA STOPS SHORT, AS THEY SEE MAESTER LUWIN WAITING IN THE
               COURTYARD, HOLDING A SCROLL, WITH GRIM NEWS.
                                    LUWIN
                         Bran…
               OSHA AND BRAN ALREADY KNOW WHAT NEWS HE BRINGS.LUWIN
               APPROACHES AND PUTS HIS HAND ON BRAN’S ARM.
               EXT. RIVERLANDS – ROBB’S ENCAMPMENT – DAY
               CATELYN WALKS GRIMLY THROUGH THE CAMP, HER EYES FIXED FORWARD.
               AS SHE PASSES EACH SOLDIER, THEY RISE, BOW THEIR HEAD
               RESPECTFULLY TO HER, AND SAY “MILADY…” CATELYN DOES NOT
               ACKNOWLEDGE THEM, BUT WALKS OUT OF THE CAMP AND INTO THE
               FOREST.  SHE COLLAPSES AGAINST A TREE, WEEPING FOR A MOMENT,
               THEN HEARS ROBB NEARBY, STRIKING A TREE WITH HIS SWORD AS HARD
               AS HE CAN IN FRUSTRATION AND ANGER. SHE APPROACHES HIM
               CAUTIOUSLY.

                   Robb… Robb?
           ROBB CANNOT HEAR HER, JUST KEEPS STRIKING THE TREE AS HARD AS
           HE CAN.
                            CATELYN
                   Robb!
           ROBB FINALLY STOPS AND LOOKS AT CATELYN. HE IS CRYING,
           EXHAUSTED, PANTING.
                            CATELYN
                   You’ve ruined your sword.
           ROBB LOOKS DOWN AT HIS SWORD, AND DROPS IT WEARILY. HE
           APPROACHES CATELYN, AND SHE HOLDS HIM CLOSE AGAINST HER.
                            CATELYN
                   Shhh…
                            ROBB
                   I’ll kill them all. Every one of them.
                   I’m gonna kill them all.
                            CATELYN
                   My boy… They have your sisters. We have
                   to get the girls back… and then, we will
                   kill them all.
           CATELYN’S EYES ARE NOW DRY, HER LOOK DETERMINED.
           INT. RED KEEP – THRONE ROOM – DAY
           KING JOFFREY HOLDS COURT, WITH CERSEI AND THE HOUND TO HIS
           SIDES. MARILLION SITS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COURT, THE CENTER
           OF ATTENTION AS HE IS FORCED TO REPLAY HIS SONG, SITTING ON THE
           FLOOR BEFORE THE THRONE. SANSA LOOKS ON FROM THE SIDE, STILL
           IN SHOCK FROM THE EXECUTION.
                            MARILLION
                            (singing)
                   The boar’s great tusks, they boded ill
                   for good King Robert’s health.
                   And the beast was every bit as fat as
                   Robert was himself.
                   But our brave king cried, “Do your

                        worst! I’ll have your ugly head!”
                        “You’re nowhere near as murd’rous as the
                        lion in my bed.”
                        King Robert lost his battle and…
                        He failed his final test.
                        The lion ripped his balls off and…
                        The boar did all the rest.
               MARILLION SEEMS RELUCTANT TO SING THE LAST LINE, BUT HURRIES
               THROUGH IT. A QUIET MURMUR RUNS THROUGH THE ROOM. KING
               JOFFREY BEGINS A SLOW, MEANINGFUL CLAP. THE CROWD PICKS UP ON
               THIS AND GIVES A VERY SHORT AND AWKWARD APPLAUSE.
                                    JOFFREY
                        Very amusing! Isn’t it a funny song?
               THE ROOM IS SILENT.
                                    JOFFREY
                        Thank you for the rendition. I imagine
                        it was even better received at that
                        tavern.
                                    MARILLION
                        I’m so sorry, Your Grace… I’ll never
                        sing it again, I swear…
                                    JOFFREY
                        Tell me, which do you favor: your
                        fingers or your tongue?
                                    MARILLION
                        Your Grace?
                                    JOFFREY
                        Fingers? Or your tongue? If you got to
                        keep one, which would it be?
               MARILLION STAMMERS, UNSURE HOW TO RESPOND.
                                    JOFFREY
                        Or I could just cut your throat…
                                    MARILLION
                        E-every man needs hands, Your Grace.

                   Ser Ilyn. Who better than you to carry
                   out the sentence?
           SER ILYN WALKS ACROSS THE COURT, DRAWING A DAGGER AND TONGS
           FROM HIS BELT. HE PAUSES AT A BRAZIER TO HEAT THE DAGGER IN
           THE FIRE.
                            MARILLION
                   No! Your Grace, please! I beg your
                   mercy.
                            JOFFREY
                   I’m done for the day. I leave the rest
                   of the matters to you, Mother.
           JOFFREY REMOVES THE CROWN AND HANDS IT TO THE HOUND.CERSEI
           WATCHES AFTER HIM, DISAPPROVING BUT EXPRESSIONLESS. JOFFREY
           APPROACHES SANSA, WHILE MARILLION SCREAMS IN THE BG AS HIS
           TONGUE IS CUT OUT.
                            JOFFREY
                   You look quite nice.
                            SANSA
                   Thank you, my lord.
                            JOFFREY
                   ‘Your Grace.’ I’m king now.Walk with
                   me. I want to show you something.
           JOFFREY WALKS AWAY, BUT SANSA STANDS STILL, WATCHING HIM.THE
           HOUND APPROACHES HER, AN UNCERTAIN LOOK IN HIS EYE.
                            HOUND
                   Do as you’re bid, child.
           SANSA FOLLOWS JOFFREY AT THIS, AND THE HOUND AND SER MERYN

                                    JOFFREY
                        …and as soon as you’ve had your blood,
                        I’ll put a son in you. Mother says that
                        shouldn’t be long…
               JOFFREY SLOWLY TURNS A CORNER AS HE FINISHES SPEAKING. THE TWO
               GUARDS STOP A FEW FEET SHORT OF THE OTHERS. SANSA LOOKS AT HIM
               A MOMENT, THEN FOLLOWS HIS GAZE TO THE ROW OF SEVERED HEADS
               SPIKED ON THE OUTER WALL.
                                    SANSA
                        No! Please, no!
               SANSA LOOKS AWAY AND TRIES TO FLEE, BUT SER MERYN HOLDS HER BY
               HER SHOULDERS. SHE TURNS HER HEAD DOWN AND REFUSES TO LOOK.
               JOFFREY IGNORES HER, ADMIRING HIS HANDIWORK.
                                    JOFFREY
                        This one’s your father, this one here.
                        Look at it, and see what happens to
                        traitors.
                                    SANSA
                        You promised to be merciful!
                                    JOFFREY
                        I was. I gave him a clean death. Look
                        at him.
                                    SANSA
                        Please, let me go home. I won’t do any
                        treason, I swear. I’ll…
                                    JOFFREY
                        Mother says I’m still to marry you, so
                        you’ll stay here and obey. Look at him!
               SANSA REALIZES SHE HAS NO CHOICE, AND LOOKS AT HER FATHER’S
               HEAD ON THE WALL. A STRANGE CALM COMES OVER HER.
                                    JOFFREY
                        Well?

                            JOFFREY
                   That’s your Septa there…
           SANSA LOOKS OVER TO THE SEPTA’S HEAD, EXPRESSIONLESS. JOFFREY
           TRIES AGAIN TO GET A REACTION.
                            JOFFREY
                   I’ll tell you what: I’m going to give
                   you a present. After I raise my armies
                   and kill your traitor brother, I’m going
                   to give you his head as well.
                            SANSA
                   Or maybe he will give me yours.
           JOFFREY STARTS TOWARDS HER AS IF TO STRIKE HER, BUT STOPS.
           SANSA LOOKS AWAY FROM THE HEADS TO GLARE AT HIM DEFIANTLY.
                            JOFFREY
                   My mother tells me a king should never
                   strike his lady. Ser Meryn.
           OBEYING, SER MERYN TURNS SANSA TOWARDS HIM AND SLAPS HER TWICE
           ACROSS THE FACE WITH HIS GAUNTLETED HAND. SHE REMAINS
           STANDING, BUT HER LIP IS BLEEDING. JOFFREY LOOKS SATISFIED,
           AND TURNS BACK TO ADMIRE HIS COLLECTION OF HEADS. SANSA
           CONSIDERS THE STEEP DROP NEXT TO THEM, AND WALKS SLOWLY TOWARDS
           JOFFREY. THE HOUND STOPS HER, NOT BETRAYING HER ACT BUT
           HANDING HER A CLOTH TO WIPE HER MOUTH.
                            HOUND
                   Here, girl.
                            JOFFREY
                   Will you obey now? Or do you need
                   another lesson?
           JOFFREY PAUSES FOR A MOMENT, BUT SANSA DOES NOT ANSWER.
                            JOFFREY
                   I’ll look for you in court.

                   what he wants.
           SANSA TRIES TO HAND THE HOUND HIS CLOTH BACK, BUT HE REFUSES.

                   You’ll be needing that again.
           THE HOUND TURNS AND WALKS AFTER THE KING, LEAVING SANSA ALONE
           ON THE BATTLEMENTS.
           EXT. RIVERLANDS – ROBB’S ENCAMPMENT – NIGHT
           LONG TABLES ARE ARRANGED OUTSIDE THE COMMAND TENT. THE
           REMNANTS OF A FEAST CLUTTER THE TABLES, BUT NOW THE NORTHERN
           LORDS, RIVER LORDS, AND MANY LESSER LORDS ARE HOLDING A HEATED
           MEETING.
                            LORD BRACKEN
                   The proper course is clear: pledge
                   fealty to King Renly and move south to
                   join our forces with his.
                            ROBB
                   Renly is not the king.
                            LORD BRACKEN
                   You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my
                   lord. He put your father to death.
                            ROBB
                   That doesn’t make Renly king. He’s
                   Robert’s youngest brother. Now Bran
                   can’t be lord of Winterfell before me,
                   Renly can’t be king before Stannis.
                            LORD BRACKEN
                   So do you mean to declare us for
                   Stannis?
           THE ASSEMBLED LORDS BEGIN ARGUING AT THIS POINT. SHOUTS CAN BE
           HEARD ABOVE THE REST: “RENLY HAS NO RIGHT!” “I WON’T FIGHT FOR
           STANNIS!” THE GREATJON STANDS, COMMANDING ATTENTION.
                            GREATJON
                   My lords… MY LORDS! Here is what I say

           AND EARNS A ROUND OF LAUGHTER FROM THE LORDS. HE HAS THEIR
           ATTENTION.
                            GREATJON
                   Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor
                   Stannis neither. Why should they rule
                   over me and mine, from some flowery seat
                   in the south? What do they know of the
                   Wall or the Wolfswood?Even their gods
                   are wrong!
           ANOTHER ROUND OF LAUGHTER.
                            GREATJON
                   Why shouldn’t we rule ourselves again?
                   It was the dragons we bowed to, and now
                   the dragons are dead!
           GREATJON DRAWS HIS SWORD, POINTING IT TOWARDS ROBB.
                            GREATJON
                   There sits the only king I mean to bend
                   my knee to. The King in the North!
           GREATJON KNEELS AT ROBB’S FEET. ROBB LOOKS SHAKEN FOR A
           MOMENT, THEN STANDS, ACCEPTING THIS ROLE. OTHER LORDS BEGIN TO
           STAND.
                            LORD KARSTARK
                   I’ll have peace on those terms. They
                   can keep their red castle, and their
                   iron chair, too.

           WORRIED. SHE MUSTERS A SMILE AS HE LOOKS AT HER, BUT IT
           QUICKLY FADES AS HE LOOKS AWAY.

           WITHOUT FURTHER HESITATION, THE GUARDS LEAD CATELYN THROUGH THE

                        Widowhood becomes you.
               CATELYN BENDS DOWN AND PICKS UP A LARGE ROCK, JUST SMALL ENOUGH
               THAT SHE CAN LIFT IT WITH ONE HAND, AND SLOWLY APPROACHES JAIME
               AS HE SPEAKS.

                        Your bed must be lonely. Is that why
                        you came? I’m not at my best, but I
                        think I could be of service. Slip out
                        of that gown and we’ll see if I’m up to
                        it.
               WITH THAT, CATELYN HITS JAIME AS HARD AS SHE CAN IN THE SIDE OF
               THE HEAD WITH THE ROCK. JAIME IS VISIBLY SHOCKED FOR A MOMENT,
               BUT RECOVERS QUICKLY.

                        sister.
                                    JAIME
                        Let me show you how. Hit me again, over
                        the ear. And again, and again. You’re
                        stronger than you look, it shouldn’t
                        take long.

                        That is what you want the world to
                        believe, isn’t it? That you don’t fear
                        death?
                                    JAIME
                        But I don’t, m’lady. The dark is coming
                        for all of us. Why cry about it?
                                    CATELYN
                        Because you are going to the deepest of
                        the seven hells, if the gods are just.
                                    JAIME
                        What gods are those? The trees your
                        husband prayed to? Where were the trees
                        when his head was getting chopped off?

                   If your gods are real, and if they are
                   just, why is the world so full of
                   injustice?
                            CATELYN
                   Because of men like you.

                   There are no men like me. Only me.
                            CATELYN
                   My son, Bran… how did he come to fall
                   from that tower?
                            JAIME
                   I pushed him out the window.
                            CATELYN
                   Why?
                            JAIME
                   I hoped the fall would kill him.
                            CATEYN
                   Why?
           CU AS JAIME CONSIDERS THIS A MOMENT, SATISFIED THAT HE HAS
           SHAKEN HER.

                   You should get some sleep. It’s going
                   to be a long war.
           CATELYN STANDS OVER HIM A MOMENT, CONSIDERING WHETHER OR NOT TO
           CRUSH HIS SKULL. SHE THEN DROPS THE ROCK AND WALKS AWAY.

               TYWIN READS A MESSAGE THAT HE JUST RECEIVED. TYWIN’S WAR
               COUNCIL IS ASSEMBLED AT THE TABLE.

                         They have my son.

                         The Stark boy appears to be less green
                         than we’d hoped.
                                    LORD LEFFORD
                         I’ve heard his wolf killed a dozen men
                         and as many horses.
                                    LORD SWIFT
                         Is it true about Stannis and Renly?

                         Both Baratheon brothers have taken up
                         against us. Jaime captured, his armies
                         scattered… it’s a catastrophe. Perhaps
                         we should sue for peace.
               TYRION BATS HIS WINE GLASS OFF THE TABLE, TO SHATTER ON THE

                         There’s your peace. Joffrey saw to that
                         when he decided to remove Ned Stark’s
                         head. You’ll have an easier time
                         drinking from that cup, than you will
                         bringing Robb Stark to the table now.
                         He’s winning, in case you hadn’t
                         noticed.

                         weak. We should march on them at once.

                         First, we must return to Casterly Rock
                         to raise more men…

               TYRION BEFORE HE LEAVES.

               BUT TYWIN TAKES IT, POURING A GLASS FOR TYRION AND THEN FOR
               HIMSELF.
                                    TYWIN
                         You were right about Eddard Stark. If
                         he were alive, we could have used him to
                         broker a peace with Winterfell and
                         Riverrun, which would have given us more
                         time to deal with Robert’s brothers.
                         But now… madness. Madness and
                         stupidity.

                         I always thought you were a stunted
                         fool. Perhaps I was wrong.
                                    TYRION
                         Half wrong… I’m new to strategy, but
                         unless we want to be surrounded by the
                         three armies, it appears we can’t stay
                         here.

                         No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will
                         head out with five hundred riders and
                         set the riverland on fire from God’s Eye
                         to the Red Fork. The rest of us will
                         regroup at Harrenhall… and you will go
                         to King’s Landing.

                         Rule. You will serve as Hand of the
                         King in my stead. You will bring that
                         boy king to heel, and his mother too, if
                         needs be. And if you get a whiff of
                         treason from any of the rest: Baelish,
                         Varys, Pycelle…

                         You’re my son.
               TYRION SOAKS ALL THIS IN, AS TYWIN STANDS TO LEAVE. JUST
               BEFORE LEAVING THE TENT, TYWIN TURNS AROUND TO ADD ONE MORE
               THOUGHT.

                         that whore to court. Do you understand?

                   was scaled like a lizard, blind, with
                   leather wings like the wings of a bat.
                   When I touched him, the skin fell from
                   his bones. Inside, he was full of
                   graveworms. I warned you that only
                   death can pay for life. You knew the
                   price.

               EXT. ESSOS – DOTHRAKI CAMP – DAY
               DANY AND JORAH STEP OUT INTO THE MIDDAY SUN, FOLLOWING MIRRI
               MAZ DUUR THROUGH A MOSTLY ABANDONED CAMP. RAKHARO APPROACHES
               AND JOINS THEM.

                        The khalasar is gone.
                                    JORAH
                        A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The
                        Dothraki follow only the strong. I’m
                        sorry, my princess.
               THEY FOLLOW MIRRI MAZ DUUL A SHORT DISTANCE FROM CAMP, WHERE
               DROGO LIES MOTIONLESS IN THE SUN, EYES STARING BLANKLY AHEAD.
                                    DANY
                        Drogo! Shekh ma shíeraki ánni.
                        (Drogo! My sun and stars.)
               DROGO DOES NOT RESPOND.
                                    DANY
                        Why is he out here alone?
                                    JORAH
                        He seems to like the warmth, princess.
               DANY LEANS IN TO KISS DROGO, BUT HE STILL LIES MOTIONLESS,
               STARING THROUGH HER.
                                    MIRRI MAZ DUUR

                       This is not life. When will he be as he
                       was?
                                  MIRRI MAZ DUUR
                       When the sun rises in the west, and sets
                       in the east. When the seas go dry, and
                       when the mountains blow in the wind like
                       leaves.
              MIRRI MAZ DUUR TURNS AND WALKS A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY. DANY
              STAND TO FOLLOW HER.

                       woman. Go.
              DANY WALKS AWAY, LEAVING THEM BEHIND AND APPROACHING THE SPOT
              WHERE MIRRI MAZ DUUL SITS.

                       It was wrong of them to burn my temple.
                       It angered the Great Shepherd.
                                  DANY
                       This was not god’s work. My child was
                       innocent.
                                  MIRRI MAZ DUUL
                       Innocent? He would have been the
                       Stallion Who Mounts the World. Now he
                       will burn no cities. Now his khalasar
                       will trample no nations into dust.

                   Saved me? Three of those riders had
                   already raped me before you saved me,
                   girl. I saw my god’s house burn.
                   There, where I had healed men and women
                   beyond counting. In the streets I saw
                   piles of heads. The head of a baker who
                   makes my bread. The head of a boy who I
                   had cured of fever, just three months
                   past. So, tell me again exactly what it
                   was, that you saved.

                   Your life.
                            MIRRI MAZ DUUL
                   Why don’t you take a look at your khal?
                   Then you will see exactly what life is
                   worth, when all the rest has gone.

               TYRION LIES ON HIS BED, AS SHAE PACKS HIS TRUNK.
                                    SHAE
                         Hand of the King.

                         So it would seem.
                                    SHAE
                         And your father said you couldn’t take
                         anyone with you to King’s Landing?
                                    TYRION
                         No, he said I couldn’t take you with me
                         to King’s Landing. He was very specific
                         on that point.
                                    SHAE
                         He knew my name?

                         He said, “Don’t bring Shae with you to
                         King’s Landing?”

                   Are you ashamed of me?Are you afraid
                   that I’m dancing around the court with
                   my tits out?
           TYRION CHUCKLES AT THIS.
                            SHAE
                   I’m funny now. I’m Shae, the funny
                   whore.
                            TYRION
                   My father’s probably the most powerful
                   man in the country certainly the
                   richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in
                   his pockets.Everybody, everywhere
                   always has to do exactly what my father
                   says… he’s always been a cunt.
           THIS BREAKS SHAE OUT OF HER ANGER, AND SHE STOPS TO LISTEN
           AGAIN.
                            TYRION
                   I believe the ladies of the court could
                   learn a great deal from a girl like you.
                   Why don’t you come with me?Be the
                   Hand’s lady.Because the King needs a
                   Hand, and the Hand…
                            SHAE
                   I know what a Hand needs…
           SHAE JUMPS ON TOP OF HIM, PLAYFULLY.

                   Kings? Oh, I can tell you all there is
                   to know about kings. The thing you need
                   to understand about kings… Over the past
                   sixty-seven years, I’ve known, truly
                   known more kings than any man alive.
                   Complicated men… but I know how to serve
                   them, and keep on serving them… [COUGH]
                   Aerys Targaryen… of all the thousand
                   thousand maladies the gods visit upon
                   us, madness is the worst. He was a good
                   man, such a charmer. But to watch him
                   melt away before my eyes, consumed by
                   dreams of fire and blood… Robert
                   Baratheon was an entirely different
                   animal.A powerful man, great warrior…
                   but alas, winning a kingdom and ruling a
                   kingdom are rather different things.

                         They say that a man goes through life
                         with battle visor down; he can often be
                         blind to the enemies at his side. Now I
                         serve his son, King Joffrey, may the
                         gods bless his reign. He is a capable
                         young man, strong military mind.Stern…
                         but sternness in the defense of the
                         realm is no vice. Well, it’s far too
                         soon to know what manner of king he will
                         be, but I sense true greatness on the

               ARYA GAPES AT THE PRISONERS AS SHE PASSES, AND CANNOT STOP
               STARING AS SHE BACKS INTO HOT PIE.
                                    HOT PIE
                        Watch yourself, midget!
                                    LOMMY
                        He’s got a sword, this one.
                                    HOT PIE
                        What’s a gutter rat like you doing with
                        a sword?
                                    LOMMY
                        Maybe he’s a little squire.
                                    HOT PIE
                        He ain’t no squire. Look at him. Looks
                        like a girl.  I bet he stole that sword.
                                    LOMMY
                        Let’s have a look.
               LOMMY REACHES FOR THE SWORD. ARYA JUMPS AWAY, RIGHT INTO HOT
               PIE, WHO PUSHES HER TO THE GROUND.
                                    HOT PIE
                        I could use me a sword like that.
                                    LOMMY
                        Well take it off him.
                                    HOT PIE
                        Give it here, midget.
                                    LOMMY
                        Look at him! You better give Hot Pie the
                        sword. I’ve seen him kick a boy to
                        death.
                                    HOT PIE
                        I knocked him down and I kicked him in
                        the balls, and I kept kicking him ‘til
                        he was dead.  I kicked him all to
                        pieces.  You better give me that sword.

               HOT PIE REACHES FOR THE SWORD. IN ONE PRACTICED MOTION, ARYA
               DRAWS THE SWORD AND HOLDS IT TO HOT PIE’S THROAT. BEFORE HE
               CAN REACT, SHE GRABS HIS OUTSTRECHED HAND AND PULLS HERSELF TO
               HER FEET, KEEPING THE SWORD TO HIS THROAT.ARYA KEEPS
               ADVANCING ON HIM, MAKING HIM STAGGER BACKWARDS.
                                    ARYA
                         You want it? I’ll give it to you. I
                         already killed one fat boy. I bet you
                         never killed anyone. I bet you’re a
                         liar. But I’m not. I’m good at killing
                         fat boys. I like killing fat boys.
               WITH THAT, ARYA BACKS HOT PIE INTO GENDRY, WHO HAS BEEN PAYING
               SOME ATTENTION TO THE CONFRONTATION. HE HAS STOPPED READYING
               THE CART, AND IS READY TO INTIMIDATE HOT PIE WHEN THEY CONNECT.
                                    GENDRY
                         Oh, you like picking on the little ones,
                         do ya? You know, I been hammering an
                         anvil these past ten years. When I hit
                         that steel, it sings. You gonna sing
                         when I hit you?
               HOT PIE AND LOMMY SCURRY AWAY IN TERROR. GENDRY STANDS NEXT TO
               ARYA. HE NOTICES HER SWORD, LIFTS IT UP BY THE BLADE.
                                    GENDRY
                         This is castle-forged steel. Where’d
                         you steal it?
                                    ARYA
                         It was a gift.

                   Ham… How many days in a row must a man
                   be expected to start his day with ham?
                   Bring me some beer, at least. You look
                   exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that
                   tiring?
           JON IS POURING A FLAGON OF BEER FOR MORMONT. HE STOPS,
           STUNNED, AND TURNS SLOWLY TO MORMONT.
                            MORMONT
                   Don’t look so terrified. If we beheaded
                   everyone who ran away for a night, only
                   ghosts would guard the Wall. At least

                   they see fires blazing in the mountains
                   from dusk until dawn. A captured
                   wildling swears their tribes are uniting
                   in some secret strongholds, to what ends
                   the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch,
                   Cotter Pikesmen discovered four blue-
                   eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise
                   enough to burn them. Do you think your
                   brother’s war is more important than
                   ours?

                   When dead men and worse come hunting for
                   us in the night, do you think it matters
                   who sits on the Iron Throne?

                   with us, when we ride out beyond the
                   Wall tomorrow.
           MORMONT THROWS THE LETTER INTO THE FIRE.

                        So I’ll only ask you once, Lord Snow:
