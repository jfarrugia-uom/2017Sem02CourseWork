              Jon Snow walks through the rubble of the Battle of Castle

              Jon Snow approaches the enemy camp outside of the 
              Wall. The wildlings draw blades and surround him. Jon 
              puts up his hands and continues walking, stopping at the 
              tent of Mance Rayder.

              Mance nods for Jon to enter a tent to make negotiations. 
              Jon follows Mance’s men into the tent. Mance extends his 
              hand signaling Jon to sit down.

        01:34:07:29  
              Meera runs to Jojen and tries to pull him back as Bran 
              and Hodor look on. 
                     MEERA 
                      Jojen!

        01:34:29:15     
              Meera frees Jojen. Hodor is attacked by a Whitewalker.

              (screeching) 
               
              Another whitewalker emerges from the ice and charges 
              at Jojen and Meera. They fight and Meera beheads the 
              Whitewalker skeleton. 
               
        01:34:40:19  
              Another Whitewalker charges at Meera and they fight. 
         
                      52 
              (grunts) 
               
              A Whitewalker emerges at Bran’s feet. The Whitewalker 
              moves on Bran and the wolf attacks it, saving Bran. 
              Hodor continues to fight off a Whitewalker, and then 
              two. 
               
        01:34:46:17  HODOR

              Bran transforms to leave his body. Bran enters (odor’s 
              body and he fights off the Whitewalkers. 
        01:35:05:05  
              (growling) 
               
              Fighting continues. Meera knocks Jojen down to keep 
              him away from the fighting.

        01:35:44:17     
              Jojen looks to Bran and sees he has left his body.

              A Whitewalker at Jojen’s side pulls a blade as everyone 
              else is distracted, fighting. 
        01:36:01:05     
         
                      53 
              Meera cuts a Whitewalker in half.

              Meera looks over to see a Whitewalker repeatedly 
              stabbing Jojen. She kills it.  Hodor turns to see two 
              Whitewalkers rushing at Bran. The Whitewalkers are hit 
              by bursts of flame.

              A girl has appeared. Hodor runs to Bran as Meera holds 
              Jojen in her lap.

              Jojen looks to Meera. 
                      JOJEN 
                    Go with them. 
        01:36:44:21     
              (ice bursting) 
               
              More Whitewalkers are coming through the ice as Meera 
              rocks Jojen in her lap. 
                      54 
         
        01:36:50:17 
              Meera removes her blade from a Whitewalker skull. 
              Meera makes a slice on Jojen (OC) and becomes 
              distraught. 
              (slices) 
               
              Meera runs away from Jojen and to the others. 
              Jojen flops his head and is dead. 
              Meera looks back. The child of the forest throws a 
              fireball to consume Jojen’s body. 
              Hodor takes Bran into a cave. 
              Another fireball is thrown and Meera and the child of the 
              forrest follow Hodor and Bran into the cave. 
              Whitewalkers try to follow them into the cave and are 
              destroyed by an invisible force.

              The child of the forest exits.  Hodor, Meera, and Bran 
              follow the child of the forest through cavernous halls. 
        01:38:18:15  
              The child of the forest emerges in an opening where a 
              raven sits on the cave floor. 
              (raven caws) 
               
              Meera, Hodor, and Bran come upon the opening.

              Jaime motions for Tyrion to go and then exits. 
              Tyrion stands at the opening. Instead of exiting to make 
              his escape, he takes a secret passage to Shae’s room. 
              Shae is sleeping in bed.

                      SHAE

              Shae reaches for a knife to attack Tyrion. 
              Tyrion climbs on top of her and overpowers her, 
              knocking the knife on the floor. Shae fights against 
              Tyrion.

              Tyrion sits on the floor next to Shae’s bed, where she 
              lays dead.

              Tyrion makes his way through a passage, carrying 
              weapons. 
              He approaches a doorway.

              Tyrion opens the door to reveal Tywin. Tyrion aims a

              Tyrion shoots Tywin with an arrow. Tyrion falls back
