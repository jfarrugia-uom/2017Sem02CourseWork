                         son! Are you an idiot? They killed my

                   north. We need to get him on broken

                   Jaime Lannister’s siege of Riverrun. Do
                   that and the river lords will join us.
                            ROBB
                   To do either we need to cross the river.
                   And the only crossing is at the twins.
