           Fade in to Davos. His mouth is open. Out of view, someone is breathing heavily. 
     
                         
           ( breathing continues )

            Jon is lying on his back, only the t op of his head and his shoulders visible. His chest moves up and 
           down. 
     
                         
           ( breathing heavily )

           Jon sits up. He takes deep breaths. He looks around and sees Davos watching him. 
     
                         
    01:02:33:00 
                         
                         
           Jon looks around, panting. He sees Ghost, who stands watching him. 
     
                         
           ( Ghost panting, whines ) 
                         
                         
    01:02:48:12 
                         
            Jon looks down at his torso. He to uches his wounds. He begins to gasp. His eyes are wide. He shakes. 
           Davos hurries to him. Jon tries to stand.

           Davos catches Jon as he loses his balance. He picks up a blanket and wraps it around Jon. 
     
                           DAVOS 
                         Easy, easy, easy. 
                         
    01:03:03:02 
                           DAVOS 
                           Easy. 
                         
    01:03:11:06 
                         
            Melisandre enters the room and s ees Jon sitting, wrapped in the blanket. Davos stands next to him. 
           Melisandre gasps. She walks forward slowly, her eyes wide. Davos bends over Jon. 
     
                           DAVOS 
                       What do you remember? 
                         
    01:03:19:16 
                         
                         
           Jon hesitates before answering, breathing hard. His expression is one of distress. 
     
                            JON 
                         They stabbed me.

                            JON 
                           Olly... 
                                       
                                       
    01:03:29:23 
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                       he put a knife in my heart. 
                                       
                                       
    01:03:38:06 
                            JON 
                         I shouldn't be here. 
                         
    01:03:42:11 
                         
                         
           Jon glances up at Davos. 
                         
                           DAVOS: 
                       The lady brought you back.

    01:03:45:02 
                         
                         
           Jon turns his gaze to Melisandre. She steps forward and kneels in front of him. She speaks urgently. 
     
                          MELISANDRE 
                     Afterwards, after they stabbed you, 
                         
    01:03:48:21 
                          MELISANDRE 
                      after you died, where did you go? 
                         
    01:03:51:02 
                        M  ELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                         What did you see? 
                         
    01:03:53:01 
                         
                         
           Davos listens intently. Jon shakes his head. 
     
                         
    01:03:57:10 
                            JON 
                           Nothing. 
                         
    01:04:02:05 
                            JON 
                       There was nothing at all. 
                         
    01:04:04:01 
                         
                         
           Melisandre looks carefully at Jon. 
     
                         
    01:04:08:09 
                          MELISANDRE 
                    The Lord let you come back for a reason. 
                         
    01:04:13:04 
                          MELISANDRE 
                   Stannis was not the prince who was promised, 
                         
    01:04:15:19 
                        M  ELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                        but someone has to be. 
                         
    01:04:17:10

           Jon bows his head. Davos looks away. 
     
                         
    01:04:22:00 
                           DAVOS 
                      Could you give us a moment? 
                         
    01:04:24:03 
                         
            Melisandre looks up at Davos. Sh e stands and leaves the room. Davos closes the door. He pulls up a 
           stool and sits next to Jon. 
     
                         
    01:04:44:14 
                           DAVOS 
                         You were dead. 
                         
    01:04:47:07 
                         
                         
           Jon slowly raises his head. 
                         
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                        And now you're not. 
                         
    01:04:49:00 
                         
                         
           Davos speaks with intensity. 
                         
                         
    01:04:50:14 
                           DAVOS 
                   That's completely fucking mad, seems to me. 
                         
    01:04:54:12 
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                    I can only imagine how it seems to you. 
                         
    01:04:56:21 
                         
            Jon's mouth moves before he is ab  le to speak. 
     
                         
    01:04:59:06 
                            JON 
                      I did what I thought was right. 
                         
    01:05:03:23 
                            JON 
                       And I got murdered for it.

           Davos listens quietly. Jon sounds near tears. 
     
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                         And now I'm back. 
                         
    01:05:09:00 
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                           Why? 
                         
    01:05:10:14 
                           DAVOS 
                          I don't know. 
                         
    01:05:12:07 
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                       Maybe we'll never know. 
                         
    01:05:14:19 
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                        What does it matter? 
                         
    01:05:16:19 
                         
                         
           Davos waits a moment. He speaks with extra emphasis. 
     
                         
    01:05:18:22 
                           DAVOS 
                          You go on. 
                         
    01:05:22:10 
                           DAVOS 
                      You fight for as long as you can. 
                         
    01:05:25:01 
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                    You clean up as much of the shit as you can. 
                         
    01:05:27:20 
                         
                         
           Jon shakes his head, looking worried. 
     
                         
    01:05:29:01 
                            JON 
                       I don't know how to do that.

                            JON 
                        I thought I did, but... 
                         
    01:05:38:11 
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                           I failed. 
                         
    01:05:40:10 
                         
                         
           Jon lowers his head again. Davos' reply is unexpected. 
     
                         
    01:05:43:03 
                           DAVOS 
                           Good. 
                         
    01:05:45:12

           Varys stops close to Nym, looking into her face. 
     
                        L ORD VARYS (CONT'D) 
                       Do you know how I do that?

                        L ORD VARYS (CONT'D)

           Nym's eyes widen. 
                         
                        L ORD VARYS (CONT'D)

           Varys circles around Nym. She turns her head to watch him. 
     
                        L ORD VARYS (CONT'D) 
                    I know who you are and what you've done.

           Now Varys turns to face Nym. 
                         
                        L ORD VARYS (CONT'D)

           Nym finally speaks. Her voice is harsh and angry. 
     
                            NYM 
                 The Unsullied and the Second Sons are foreign soldiers

           Varys nods. His tone is mild. 
                         
                          LORD VARYS 
                          I understand.

           Varys begins to stroll again. Nym watches him with suspicion. 
     
                        L ORD VARYS (CONT'D) 
                      Well, that makes perfect sense

                    I have a different perspective, of course. 
                         
    01:23:45:02 
                        L ORD VARYS (CONT'D) 
               I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective 
                         
    01:23:48:13 
                        L ORD VARYS (CONT'D) 
                    just as I will try to see them from yours. 
                         
    01:23:50:23 
                        L ORD VARYS (CONT'D) 
                       Because that is the only way 
                         
    01:23:53:07

           Again Varys walks close to Nym. She looks at him without answering.

           Varys smiles. His voice is quiet, but Nym looks afraid.

            Tyrion sits at a table. Grey Worm  and Missandei sit across from him. There is a polite silence. Tyrion 
           clasps his hands together. He smiles. Grey Worm does not smile back. 
     
                         
    01:25:48:15 
                           TYRION 
                     What should we do while we wait?

                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     To pass the time, what should we do? 
                         
    01:25:52:10 
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       What should we talk about?

           Grey Worm and Missandei stare at him. Then they look at each other. They look back at Tyrion. 
     
                         
    01:25:57:01 
                           TYRION

                You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.

           Tyrion takes a sip from a cup. He sets it down and struggles on with the conversation. 
     
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                  You two, you spend a great deal of time together. 
                         
    01:26:05:19 
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                  What would you be talking about if I weren't here?

           Grey Worm finally speaks.

           Tyrion looks at him with an inviting expression.

           Tyrion nods, speaking cheerfully. 
     
                           TYRION 
                      That's good. That's very good.

           Tyrion stands, holding his glass.

                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     I was thinking more of a conversation.

    01:26:52:09 
                         
            Tyrion returns to the table and pu ts down his glass. Grey Worm and Missandei do not react. Tyrion 
           speaks with surprise. 
     
                         
    01:26:55:08

           Grey Worm answers in a monotone.

           Tyrion responds with enthusiasm. He sits. 
     
                           TYRION 
                        There, that's a start.

           Tyrion is not daunted. He leans forward and smiles again. 
     
                           TYRION 
                          Until you do.

           Grey Worm and Missandei again stare without answering. Tyrion drums his fingers on the table.

           Tyrion stops and thinks for a moment. 
     
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     maybe we can't play without drinking.

           Tyrion looks around. Grey Worm and Missandei stand as Varys enters.

           Qyburn crosses the room. He picks up a small wooden box and opens it. A table holds identical boxes.

           Gregor leans toward Jaime in a threatening way. Jaime draws back.

           Jaime walks to one side and picks up a chair. He returns to the table and slams it down.

           The High Sparrow answers his own question. 
     
                         
    01:35:46:02 
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                     It was through their own mothers.

           The High Sparrow looks directly at Tommen. 
     
                         
    01:35:50:16 
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                 There's a great deal of falsehood in Cersei. You know that. 
                         
    01:35:54:04 
                       HIGH  SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all. 
                         
    01:35:58:04 
                         
           The High Sparrow speaks with emotion.

    01:36:05:08 
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                    because it doesn't come from this world.

                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                     You've seen her when she talks to you.

           Tommen answers quietly. 
                         
                         
    01:36:17:07 
                          TOMMEN 
                            Yes.

           The High Sparrow smiles. He gestures at a bench.

           Tommen replies stiffly.

           The High Sparrow sits. He places his hands on his knees.

           The end of a staff drags along the ground. It passes a pair of sandaled feet. 
     
            Arya lifts her head, listening. She  turns. The Waif approaches from her other side and taps Arya with

           The staff taps Arya's back. She swings around.

           Umber straightens and turns away. He nods at one of his men. Ramsay speaks drily.

    01:45:05:04 
                         
            Umber's men bring two hooded fig  ures into the room and march them up to Ramsay's table. Umber 
           sounds amused.

           Umber pulls off one figure's hood. It is a girl, who looks around in fear. Ramsay smiles.

            Karstark stands. Umber pulls the  hood off the other figure. A young boy looks around in confusion, his 
           mouth open. Ramsay walks toward the boy.

            Umber turns and walks toward the d oor. He returns holding a wolf's head and throws it on the table. 
           Ramsay looks at it. Then he looks at the boy and smiles.

            Tormund stands in the courtyard  among a group of men. Jon walks through the crowd and up the 
           steps to the gallows platform. He looks at four men who stand with nooses around their necks and 
           their hands behind their backs.

            Jon stares without replying. Then h  e moves on to the last man. He appears to have trouble looking this 
           one in the face, but eventually he looks up. The man is Olly. The two look at each other without 
           speaking. Jon turns away and draws his sword. He walks to the edge of the platform, breathing 
           heavily, his face filled with sorrow. The men in the courtyard wait. On an upper walkway, Melisandre 
           waits. Finally, Jon raises his sword and slashes a rope. Barrels roll out from under a plank the men

           stand on, and they lose their footing. Jon watches as they kick and choke. Some men in the courtyard 
           lower their heads.

           Finally the bodies hang still. Olly is dead. Jon sheathes his sword. He walks toward Edd.
