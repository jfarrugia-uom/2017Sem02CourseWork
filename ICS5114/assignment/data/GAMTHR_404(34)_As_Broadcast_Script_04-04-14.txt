               how I came into his service? 
         
        01:11:52:13   JAIME 
                 You stood for him in 
              his trial by combat at the Eyrie. 
         
        01:11:55:14   BRONN 
                      Aye. 
        01:11:57:19  BRONN (CONT’D) 
             But only when Lady Arryn demanded

        01:12:07:05  BRONN (CONT’D) 
              because he knew you would ride 
             day and night to come fight for him. 
         
        01:12:12:09  BRONN (CONT’D)

                Her son died in her arms. 
         
        01:12:54:26  TYRION 
                     Her son? 
        01:12:57:16   JAIME 
                     Don't. 
        01:13:04:12   JAIME 
                You know what's coming? 
        01:13:06:20  TYRION 
                 My trial for regicide.  
                    Yes, I know. 
        01:13:10:27 TYRION (CONT’D) 
              I know the whole bloody country 
                  thinks I'm guilty. 
        01:13:14:22  
                 TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
             I know that one of my three judges 
        01:13:16:22   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  has wished me dead  
               more times than I can count. 
                        
        01:13:19:06  
                       20 
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
               And that judge is my father. 
        01:13:22:24  
                 TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                   As for Cersei, 
        01:13:24:10   TYRION (CONT’D) 
            well, she's probably working on a way 
        01:13:26:10   TYRION (CONT’D) 
               to avoid a trial altogether  
                 by having me killed. 
         
        01:13:29:02   JAIME 
                Now that you mention it,  
                    she did ask. 
        01:13:32:14  TYRION 
                So, should I turn around  
                  and close my eyes? 
        01:13:35:15   JAIME 
                     Depends. 
        01:13:37:17  JAIME (CONT’D) 
                   Did you do it? 
        01:13:39:26  TYRION 
                The Kingslayer brothers. 
                        
        01:13:41:22 TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    You like it?  
                        
                 TYRION (CONT’D – OS) 
                    I like it. 
                       21 
        01:13:46:26   TYRION (CONT’D) 
          You're really asking if I killed your son? 
         
        01:13:49:17   JAIME 
          Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? 
        01:13:56:23  JAIME (CONT’D) 
                 How can I help you? 
        01:13:59:16  TYRION 
               Well, you could set me free. 
         
        01:14:02:12   JAIME 
                  You know I can't. 
         
        01:14:04:11  TYRION 
                 Then there's really  
                 nothing else to say. 
             Tyrion gets up from the cell floor. 
              
        01:14:07:12   JAIME 
               What do you want me to do?  
                  Kill the guards? 
         
        01:14:09:23     
                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
                Sneak you out of the city 
                 in the back of a cart? 
        01:14:11:10  
                      JAIME 
           I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. 
                       22 
         
        01:14:13:09  
                     TYRION 
                 Sorry, I'd forgotten. 
        01:14:15:03 
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  I'd hate for you  
              to do something inappropriate. 
         
        01:14:17:07  JAIME (OS) 
                   Inappropriate? 
        01:14:18:26  JAIME (CONT’D) 
             You're accused of killing the king.  
                Freeing you is treason. 
         
        01:14:21:19  TYRION 
                 Except I didn't do it. 
        01:14:23:20   JAIME 
             Which is why we're having a trial. 
        01:14:25:20  TYRION 
                     A trial. 
        01:14:27:28 TYRION (CONT’D) 
               If the killer threw himself  
                before the Iron Throne, 
         
        01:14:30:28  
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
         confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable 
                 evidence of his guilt, 
                       23 
         
        01:14:35:03  
                 TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
              it wouldn't matter to Cersei. 
         
        01:14:36:18   TYRION (CONT’D) 
          She won't rest until my head's on a spike. 
         
        01:14:39:19     
                      JAIME 
                   Not just yours. 
        01:14:41:24  JAIME (CONT’D) 
               She's offering a knighthood  
              to whomever finds Sansa Stark. 
        01:14:45:03  TYRION 
              Sansa couldn't have done this. 
        01:14:46:25   JAIME 
                 She had more reason  
             than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. 
        01:14:49:10  JAIME (CONT’D) 
         Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared 
               the same night Joffrey died? 
         
        01:14:52:05  TYRION 
                    No, but... 
        01:14:55:11   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 Sansa's not a killer. 
         
        01:14:59:26   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                       24 
                  Not yet, anyway. 
         
        01:15:01:19  
             INT. KING’S LANDING - DAY 
             (wood creaking)  
             (men shouting) 
         
         
        01:15:07:21  
              
             (footsteps approaching) 
         
        01:15:14:25 
             Littlefinger comes down the stairs to 
             Sansa’s prison.   
                        
                        
                      SANSA 
                Where are you taking me? 
        01:15:17:00   LITTLEFINGER (OS) 
            I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. 
        01:15:19:06  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
             She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. 
        01:15:21:12  
               LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D - OS) 
                 You'll be safe there. 
             Sansa nods and walks to the other side of 
             the room. 
        01:15:36:06   SANSA 
                 Did you kill Joffrey? 
        01:15:38:00  LITTLEFINGER 
                 Did I kill Joffrey? 
                       25 
             Littlefinger walks into the prison and 
             hangs his hand against a beam. 
              
              
        01:15:42:18  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
             I've been in the Vale for weeks. 
        01:15:44:15   SANSA 
                  I know it was you. 
        01:15:45:23  LITTLEFINGER 
           And who helped me with this conspiracy? 
        01:15:51:21   SANSA 
               Well, there was Ser Dontos. 
        01:15:53:19  SANSA (CONT’D) 
          You used him to get me out of King's Landing, 
        01:15:55:25  SANSA (CONT’D) 
          but you would never trust him to kill the king. 
        01:15:58:11  LITTLEFINGER 
                     Why not? 
                        
                      SANSA 
          Because you’re too smart to trust a drunk. 
        01:16:02:07  LITTLEFINGER 
             Then perhaps it was your husband. 
        01:16:04:20   SANSA 
                      No. 
        01:16:06:09   LITTLEFINGER (OS) 
                  How do you know? 
                       26 
        01:16:08:02   SANSA 
        01:16:10:22  I just do. 
                    LITTLEFINGER 
                   You’re right. 
        01:16:12:29  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
            He wasn't involved in Joffrey's death. 
        01:16:15:12  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   But you were. 
        01:16:18:23  
               LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D - OS) 
            Do you remember that lovely necklace  
                  Dontos gave you? 
        01:16:22:08  
               LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D - OS) 
               I don't suppose you noticed  
                that a stone was missing 
        01:16:26:09 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D - OS) 
                  after the feast. 
         
        01:16:28:21   SANSA 
                    The poison. 
        01:16:33:01  SANSA (CONT’D) 
                 I don't understand. 
         
        01:16:35:09  SANSA (CONT’D) 
            The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. 
        01:16:37:22  SANSA (CONT’D) 
           Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal. 
                       27 
        01:16:39:17  LITTLEFINGER 
          A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. 
        01:16:42:23  
               LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D - OS) 
              Always keep your foes confused. 
        01:16:45:12  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
         If they don't know who you are or what you want, 
        01:16:48:10  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
           they can't know what you plan to do next. 
        01:16:54:10   SANSA 
                 I don't believe you. 
        01:16:57:28  
                 SANSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                  If they catch you,  
             they'll put your head on a spike 
        01:17:00:17  
                 SANSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                 just like my father's. 
         
        01:17:01:27  SANSA (CONT’D) 
            You'd risk that just to confuse them? 
         
        01:17:06:25  
             Littlefinger walks towards Sansa. 
              
                    LITTLEFINGER 
             So many men, they risk so little. 
        01:17:10:12  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
           They spend their lives avoiding danger. 
        01:17:13:11  
                       28 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                  And then they die. 
        01:17:17:04  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
           I'd risk everything to get what I want. 
        01:17:20:26     
                      SANSA 
                 And what do you want? 
             Littlefinger slides his hand down Sansa’s 
             shoulder. 
        01:17:29:26  LITTLEFINGER 
                    Everything. 
        01:17:33:10  
               LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D - OS) 
        My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. 
         
        01:17:36:23 
             Littlefinger walks to the other side of 
             the room.    
                        
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    But Joffrey, 
        01:17:39:13     
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
           a vicious boy with a crown on his head, 
        01:17:42:02  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                is not a reliable ally. 
         
         
        01:17:44:13  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
           And who could trust a friend like that? 
         
        01:17:46:10   SANSA 
                       29 
                 Who could trust you? 
        01:17:49:28  LITTLEFINGER 
              I don't want friends like me. 
        01:17:52:08  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
              My new friends are predictable. 
        01:17:54:20  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                Very reasonable people. 
        01:17:56:11  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
             As for what happened to Joffrey, 
         
        01:17:59:03  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                well, that was something  
             my new friends wanted very badly. 
        01:18:03:13  
             EXT. Garden – Day. 
               LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D - OS) 
              Nothing like a thoughtful gift 
         
        01:18:05:26  
               LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D - OS) 
            to make a new friendship grow strong. 
         
        01:18:08:12  
             Margaery and Olenna walk arm in arm 
             through the garden. 
                        
                        
                     MARGAERY 
              I can't believe you're going. 
        01:18:10:15   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
           Leaving me alone here with these people. 
                       30 
         
        01:18:13:06  OLENNA (OS) 
               The time has come, my dear. 
        01:18:15:15  
                 OLENNA (CONT’D - OS) 
          There's nothing more tedious than a trial. 
        01:18:18:11   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
              Except perhaps these gardens. 
         
         
        01:18:21:00   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
          If I have to take one more leisurely stroll 
        01:18:23:27   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
                 through these gardens,  
             I'll fling myself from the cliffs. 
             Margaery and Olenna walk inside a covered 
             porch. 
         
        01:18:27:00  
             (Margaery laughs) 
        01:18:28:14   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
             Have you been to see Tommen yet? 
        01:18:30:15  MARGAERY 
                      No. 
        01:18:32:16  
             Olenna sits down and Margaery stands and 
             looks at her. 
              
                  MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
             Have they even agreed to the match? 
                       31 
         
        01:18:34:15  MARGAERY 
                No one tells me anything. 
        01:18:36:12  OLENNA 
           I wasn't originally meant to marry your 
              grandfather Luthor, you know. 
        01:18:40:12   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
               He was engaged to my sister, 
        01:18:42:27   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
                 your great-aunt Viola. 
                        
             Margaery sits down at the table with 
             Olenna 
         
        01:18:45:07   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
          I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. 
        01:18:48:13   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
         Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. 
        01:18:52:02   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
             But the moment I saw my intended, 
        01:18:54:23   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
            with his twitchy little ferret's face 
        01:18:58:01   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
               and ludicrous silver hair, 
        01:18:59:29   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
                 I knew he wouldn't do. 
        01:19:02:03  
                       32 
                   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
                   So the evening 
             Maergery leans in to listen. 
         
        01:19:04:25   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
          before Luthor was to propose to my sister, 
        01:19:07:28   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
                I got lost on my way back 
                from my embroidery lesson 
        01:19:10:19  
                 OLENNA (CONT’D - OS) 
              and happened upon his chamber. 
                        
             Maergery smiles at Olenna 
         
        01:19:12:26  
             (laughs) 
        01:19:14:06   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
                How absentminded of me. 
                     MARGAERY 
                     Mm-hmm. 
        01:19:16:19  OLENNA 
                 The following morning,  
            Luthor never made it down the stairs 
        01:19:20:25     
                   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
                to propose to my sister  
            'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk. 
         
        01:19:24:09   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
                  And once he could,  
                       33 
                the only thing he wanted 
        01:19:26:26   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
           was what I'd given him the night before. 
        01:19:29:07  
                 OLENNA (CONT’D - OS) 
                    I was good. 
        01:19:31:12   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
                 I was very, very good. 
        01:19:35:27   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
                 You are even better. 
        01:19:38:18   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
               But you need to act quickly. 
         
        01:19:40:09   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
                 Cersei may be vicious,  
                 but she's not stupid. 
        01:19:44:07   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
              She'll turn the boy against you 
                 as soon as she can. 
         
        01:19:47:05   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
              And by the time you're married,  
                  it'll be too late. 
                        
             Olenna brushes Margaery’s hair behind her 
             shoulder.  
         
        01:19:50:08   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
             Luckily for you, the Queen Regent 
        01:19:52:13  
                       34 
                   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
             is rather distracted at the moment. 
        01:19:54:09  
                 OLENNA (CONT’D - OS) 
              mourning her dear departed boy. 
        01:19:56:23  
                 OLENNA (CONT’D - OS) 
             Accusing her brother of his murder, 
        01:19:59:02   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
                which he didn't commit. 
        01:20:01:03  MARGAERY 
                Well, he could have done. 
                        
        01:20:02:10     
                     OLENNA 
             He could have done, but he didn't. 
         
        01:20:04:09  MARGAERY 
               You don't know, Grandmother. 
                     OLENNA 
                   But I do know. 
        01:20:07:10  
                 OLENNA (CONT’D - OS) 
               You don't think I'd let you 
                marry that beast, do you? 
        01:20:13:00  MARGAERY 
                What? I don't understand. 
        01:20:16:02  OLENNA 
         Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. 
                        
             Orlenna adjusts Margaery’s necklace. 
                       35 
         
        01:20:21:27   OLENNA (CONT’D) 
             You just do what needs to be done. 
             Margaery stares at Orlenna. 
              
              
        01:20:25:25  JON (OS) 
                  Bring it through! 
        01:20:27:23     
             EXT. THE WALL – DAY. 
              
             (swords clanging) 
        01:20:35:02  
             Two men are swordfighting. 
              
                    JON (CONT’D) 
                    And again. 
        01:20:42:25   JON 
             (laughs) 
              
             They stop swordfighting. 
              
                    JON (CONT’D) 
                  Very nice. Good. 
        01:20:46:13  JON (CONT’D) 
                A lot of wildlings fight  
               with a weapon in each hand. 
        01:20:49:09  JON (CONT’D) 
               First thing you want to do 
        01:20:52:07  
             Jon addresses a group of onlooking men. 
              
              
                       36 
                    JON (CONT’D) 
           is disarm them to try and even the odds. 
                        
             Jon hands his sparing partner a sword. 
             They stand off and Jon’s sparing partner 
             lunges at him. Jon bests him. 
              
        01:21:08:27  JON (CONT’D) 
               Let's see what you can do. 
             Olly smiles.  
              
              
        01:21:12:13  
             Olly steps forward 
                    JON (CONT’D) 
              Olly, you just watch for now. 
        01:21:14:11   OLLY 
                    I can fight. 
        01:21:15:16   JON 
             Have you ever held a sword before? 
        01:21:17:19   OLLY 
            I was the best archer in our hamlet. 
        01:21:19:19  
              (men laugh)  
                        
                   OLLY (CONT’D) 
                     I was! 
        01:21:22:00   GRENN 
                   I believe you. 
        01:21:24:07  GRENN (CONT’D) 
                       37 
            We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. 
        01:21:26:01 GRENN (CONT’D) 
               Right now, watch and learn. 
                        
             Olly hangs his head and steps back. 
              
        01:21:30:02  
             Jon points his sword at two men in the 
             group. 
                      JON 
                     You two. 
        01:21:32:04  JON (CONT’D) 
           Take it slow, try and disarm each other. 
                        
             Jon hands his sword to one of the men. 
             They go to fight. 
              
              
        01:21:43:03  
             (shouts) 
         
        01:21:47:11  
             (groans) 
              
             Locke hits his opponent in the face and he 
             falls to the ground. 
         
        01:22:01:02  JON (CONT’D) 
                 You know how to fight. 
        01:22:02:27  JON (CONT’D) 
             You could have gone easier on him. 
        01:22:05:12   LOCKE 
          He wouldn't have learned anything that way. 
                       38 
        01:22:07:22  ALLISER (OS) 
                    Lord Snow. 
        01:22:10:22  
             Alliser enters the practice area and walks 
             toward Jon and Locke. 
                     ALLISER 
              What do you think you're doing? 
        01:22:13:11   JON 
              Grenn and I were helping them. 
        01:22:15:26  ALLISER 
             Grenn's a ranger. You're a steward. 
        01:22:17:26     
                  ALLISER (CONT’D) 
                 Maybe you forgot that while 
             you were off with your wildling bitch, 
        01:22:21:07   ALLISER (CONT’D) 
                   but I didn't. 
         
        01:22:23:09   JON 
               Someone has to train them. 
         
        01:22:25:20  ALLISER 
               And that someone isn't you. 
        01:22:27:17   ALLISER (CONT’D) 
              Go find a chamber pot to empty. 
             Jon moves toward Alliser and stares him 
             down. 
        01:22:32:11 ALLISER (CONT’D) 
                       39 
                   Go on. Do it. 
        01:22:35:02   ALLISER (CONT’D) 
                 You traitor's bastard. 
        01:22:37:06   ALLISER (CONT’D) 
                  Give me an excuse. 
        01:22:39:07   ALLISER (CONT’D) 
            Mormont's not here to protect you now. 
                        
             Jon stares at Alliser and then walks away. 
              
        01:22:53:00   ALLISER (CONT’D) 
                  Get back to work. 
        01:22:55:15   ALLISER (CONT’D) 
                      Now! 
        01:22:57:28  
                 ALLISER (CONT’D - OS) 
                    I said now! 
        01:23:03:22   SLYNT 
                The bastard's well-liked. 
                    You're not. 
        01:23:06:28  ALLISER 
             You think I care if they like me?  
                   We're at war. 
        01:23:09:10   SLYNT 
                     For now. 
        01:23:10:26  SLYNT (CONT’D) 
          But you can't be acting commander forever. 
                       40 
        01:23:13:06  SLYNT (CONT’D) 
                There will be a choosing. 
        01:23:15:09  SLYNT (CONT’D) 
             The old maester will insist on it. 
        01:23:17:10  SLYNT (CONT’D) 
                 You might reconsider 
        01:23:19:27  SLYNT (CONT’D) 
             his request to march on Craster's. 
        01:23:22:18  SLYNT (CONT’D) 
            Let the mutineers take care of Snow. 
        01:23:26:02  
             Alliser and Slynt look at each other. 
                   SLYNT (CONT’D) 
            Or you might be taking orders from him 
        01:23:28:19  SLYNT (CONT’D) 
                 the rest of your life. 
                        
           Alliser walks away and Slynt stays to look 
           on. Jon chooses another sword from the 
           stockpile. 
              
        01:23:45:21  
             Locke approaches Jon at the weapon’s

                My father was highborn.

                What brought you up here? 
        01:24:10:19   LOCKE 
                  A sense of duty. 
        01:24:12:19  LOCKE (CONT’D) 
                 I wanted to do my part  
               for the safety of the realm. 
         
        01:24:16:29

        01:24:18:26  LOCKE (CONT’D) 
            I was a game warden in the Stormlands.

        01:24:25:24  LOCKE (CONT’D) 
             Chose the Wall over losing my hand. 
        01:24:28:05  LOCKE (CONT’D) 
               Figured I wouldn't have to  
             suck up to any highborn cunts here. 
                        
        They both look over to Alliser yelling at people. 
         
         
        01:24:31:24  ALLISER 
                Come on, get on with it.

             (knocking) 
        01:24:43:29 
             Wine is being poured.

             (knocking) 
              
                       43 
             Cersei takes a drink and ignores the 
           knocking. 
              
        01:24:57:14  JAIME (OS) 
                        
               You sent for me, Your Grace? 
         
        01:24:59:17  CERSEI 
                    Your Grace. 
        01:25:01:18   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                  How formal of you. 
        01:25:05:10   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
              How many Kingsguards are posted 
                 outside Tommen's door? 
        01:25:08:19   JAIME 
              Ser Boros is on duty tonight. 
        01:25:12:03   JAIME 
                 Tomorrow I believe… 
                        
             Jaime enters and closes the door. 
                     CERSEI 
                     …So one? 
                        
        01:25:15:21     
                     CERSEI 
          You have one man guarding the future king? 
        01:25:18:16   JAIME 
               I promise you Tommen's safe. 
        01:25:20:17  
                       44 
                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
                 We're protecting him. 
                        
             Jaime walks down the stairs into the room. 
              
        01:25:22:00  CERSEI 
              The way you protected Joffrey? 
        01:25:26:14   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
             Why did Catelyn Stark set you free? 
        01:25:28:29   JAIME 
                      What? 
                        
                     CERSEI 
              I've been wondering for months. 
        01:25:31:24  CERSEI (CONT’D 
                Ever since that great cow  
             brought you back to the capital. 
        01:25:36:14 CERSEI (CONT’D - OS) 
                Why did she set you free? 
         
        01:25:38:06   JAIME 
                You know why. She'd hoped 
             I'd send her daughters back to her. 
           Cersei gets up from her seat and walks around 
           toward Jaime. 
         
        01:25:46:06  CERSEI 
              She hoped or did you promise? 
        01:25:48:04   JAIME 
                I swore by all the gods 
                       45 
         
        01:25:50:00  JAIME (CONT’D) 
             that if her daughters were alive,  
                I'd return them to her. 
        01:25:52:12  CERSEI 
            So you made a sacred vow to the enemy. 
        01:25:54:15   JAIME 
               I wanted to get back to you. 
        01:25:58:07  JAIME (CONT’D) 
             Should I have told her to fuck off? 
        01:25:59:28  CERSEI 
                You didn't mean it, then? 
        01:26:02:01   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
            You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark? 
        01:26:05:00     
                      JAIME 
                 Catelyn Stark's dead. 
        01:26:06:24  CERSEI 
                 So if I told you to  
               leave the capital right now  
                   and find Sansa, 
         
         
        01:26:09:08  
                 CERSEI (CONT’D - OS) 
                 if I told you to find  
               that murderous little bitch 
        01:26:13:08   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                 and bring me her head, 
                       46 
        01:26:15:13   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                  would you do it? 
                        
             Jaime stares at Cersei in silence. 
              
        01:26:22:07   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
              I know you went to see Tyrion. 
             Jaime nods.  
         
         
        01:26:26:19   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
             That creature who murdered our son. 
        01:26:32:23   JAIME 
                  I had to see him. 
        01:26:35:03  JAIME (CONT’D) 
                I had to know for myself. 
        01:26:36:19  CERSEI 
        01:26:40:07   And? 
              Jaime walks toward Cersei. 
                      JAIME 
                He didn't do it, Cersei. 
        01:26:42:26  CERSEI 
                You've always pitied him. 
        01:26:45:10   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                Our poor little brother. 
        01:26:48:20  
             Cersei walks away from Jaime. 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
                       47 
                 Abused by the world. 
        01:26:50:13   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
             Despised by his father and sister. 
        01:26:52:18   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
              He'd kill us all if he could. 
        01:26:58:04 
             Cersei turns toward Jaime. 
                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
         I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. 
                        
             Jaime starts to walk toward Cersei. 
         
        01:27:03:11   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
             That will be all, Lord Commander. 
        01:27:33:13  
             (sighs) 
        01:27:38:16  
             INT. – TOMMEN’S CHAMBERS – NIGHT.

        01:27:40:11  TOMMEN 
                    Ser Pounce? 
                        
             Tommen sits up in bed. 
         
        01:27:45:18

                       48 
             Margaery enters Tommen’s chambers and 
             walks toward his bed. 
                    TOMMEN (OS) 
            How did you get past the Kingsguard? 
        01:27:58:18  MARGAERY 
                    Kingsguard. 
                        
             Margaery approaches Tommen’s bedside. 
         
        01:28:02:24  TOMMEN 
           I don’t think you’re supposed to be here. 
        01:28:06:01     
                   TOMMEN (CONT’D) 
                Mother doesn't allow me  
               to have visitors at night. 
        01:28:08:29  MARGAERY 
              I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. 
        01:28:11:14   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
             Word has it I'm to be your bride. 
        01:28:19:23   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                Did you know that people 
                 in arranged marriages 
        01:28:22:11   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
           often never meet until their wedding day? 
              
             Margaery sits down on Tommen’s bed. 
         
        01:28:28:04  
                 MARGAERY (CONT’D - OS) 
         Before we decide to spend our lives together, 
        01:28:31:21     
                       49 
                  MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
            we ought to get to know one another. 
        01:28:33:29   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                  Don't you think? 
        01:28:37:19  TOMMEN 
                      Yes. 
        01:28:39:16  TOMMEN 
               But if my mother found out-- 
        01:28:41:18  MARGAERY 
               It can be our secret. Hmm? 
        01:28:46:06   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
             If we're going to be man and wife, 
        01:28:48:22   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
          we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. 
        01:28:54:02  
                 MARGAERY (CONT’D - OS) 
                  So, Your Grace... 
         
        01:28:56:17  TOMMEN 
                      Yes? 
        01:28:58:28   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                  Tell me a secret. 
        01:29:05:24  
             (cat meows) 
              
             Ser Pounce jumps up on Tommen’s bed. 
              (laughs) 
                       50 
        01:29:09:05   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
             Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow? 
        01:29:11:18  TOMMEN 
                  That's Ser Pounce. 
        01:29:13:29  MARGAERY 
                   Very handsome. 
        01:29:18:11  TOMMEN (OS) 
                Joffrey didn't like him. 
        01:29:19:27   TOMMEN (CONT’D) 
              He threatened to skin him alive 
        01:29:22:11   TOMMEN (CONT’D) 
             and mix his innards up in my food 
        01:29:24:05   TOMMEN (CONT’D) 
            so I wouldn't know I was eating him. 
        01:29:26:00  MARGAERY 
                  That's very cruel. 
        01:29:28:27     
                  MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
              You don't strike me as cruel. 
        01:29:33:06  TOMMEN 
                      No. 
        01:29:34:29   TOMMEN (CONT’D) 
                 I don't think I am. 
        01:29:36:26  MARGAERY 
                  That's a relief. 
                       51 
         
        01:29:38:27   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
          Because you know what happens when we marry? 
        01:29:41:06  TOMMEN 
          We say our vows in front of the high septon. 
        01:29:43:19   TOMMEN (CONT’D) 
           And after the ceremony, there's a feast-- 
        01:29:45:14  MARGAERY  
              When we marry, I become yours. 
        01:29:47:24   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                     Forever. 
        01:29:52:06   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                  It's getting late. 
        01:29:53:27  
             (sighs) 
         
        01:29:55:22   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                    I should go. 
        01:29:58:07   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
               May I come and visit you again? 
             Tommen nods. 
         
        01:30:02:06  
             (laughs)   
                  MARGAERY (CONT’D)

             Margaery leans in toward Tommen. 
              
        01:30:11:15   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
                  our little secret. 
           Margaery kisses Tommen on the forehead and

             INT. CASTLE – DAY 
              
             Jaime is walking around a table. 
              
                    BRIENNE (OS) 
                 Ser Jaime Lannister. 
        01:30:53:24  
                 BRIENNE (CONT’D - OS) 
            Knighted and named to the Kingsguard 
                  in his 16th year. 
        01:30:57:16  
                 BRIENNE (CONT’D - OS) 
              At the sack of King's Landing, 
        01:31:00:04 MARGAERY (CONT’D - OS) 
               murdered his king Aerys II. 
                       53 
         
        01:31:02:19   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
              Pardoned by Robert Baratheon. 
        01:31:07:04   MARGAERY (CONT’D) 
            Thereafter known as “the Kingslayer." 
        01:31:09:06     
                      JAIME 
             It's the duty of the Lord Commander 
                  to fill those pages. 
        01:31:15:18  
             Jaime looks at his sword. 
                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
            And there's still room left on mine. 
                        
             Jaime walks to his sword to pick it up. He 
             walks over to hand it to Brienne. 
         
        01:31:48:13  BRIENNE 
                   Valyrian steel. 
        01:31:50:28  JAIME (OS) 
                      Mmm. 
        01:31:53:15  JAIME (CONT’D) 
                    It's yours. 
        01:31:54:25  BRIENNE 
                 I can't accept this. 
        01:31:56:17  JAIME (OS) 
           It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. 
        01:31:58:27  JAIME (CONT’D) 
         You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. 
                       54 
         
        01:32:03:18  JAIME (CONT’D) 
               You swore an oath to return  
             the Stark girls to their mother. 
        01:32:07:18  JAIME (CONT’D) 
                  Lady Stark's dead. 
        01:32:09:28  JAIME (CONT’D) 
               Arya's probably dead, too, 
        01:32:12:03  
                 JAIME (CONT’D - OS) 
           but there's still a chance to find Sansa 
                and get her somewhere safe. 
        01:32:16:15  JAIME (CONT’D) 
             I've got something else for you. 
                        
             Jaime walks across the room and uncovers a 
        suit of armor.  
         
        01:32:36:26  
             Brienne walks toward the armor and touches 
             it. 
                 JAIME (CONT’D - OS) 
            I hope I got your measurements right. 
        01:32:41:24  BRIENNE 
                   I'll find her. 
             Jaime nods.  
         
        01:32:45:06  
                 BRIENNE (CONT’D - OS) 
                  For Lady Catelyn. 
        01:32:51:10 BRIENNE (CONT’D) 
                       55 
                    And for you. 
        01:32:59:28   JAIME 
                  I almost forgot. 
        01:33:03:00  JAIME (CONT’D) 
                 I have one more gift. 
        01:33:09:03  
             EXT. KING’S LANDING - DAY 
                        
             Jaime stands next to a young man. 
                     BRIENNE 
                 I don't need a squire. 
        01:33:11:00   JAIME 
                  Of course you do. 
        01:33:12:28  BRIENNE 
                 He'll slow me down. 
        01:33:14:12   JAIME 
               My brother owes him a debt.  
                 He's not safe here. 
        01:33:17:02  JAIME (CONT’D) 
              You're keeping him from harm.  
                   It's chivalry. 
         
        01:33:19:17  PODRICK 
               I won't slow you down, ser-- 
        01:33:24:01   PODRICK (CONT’D) 
                     my lady. 
        01:33:26:05  
                       56 
                 PODRICK (CONT’D – OS) 
              I promise I'll serve you well. 
        01:33:28:13   JAIME 
           See? He's a good lad. You'll get along. 
        01:33:35:27 
             Bronn approaches Podrick, touches him on 
             the shoulder and hands him an axe. 
                      BRONN 
               Compliments of Lord Tyrion. 
        01:33:38:10  BRONN (CONT’D) 
               His axe from the Blackwater. 
        01:33:46:16  BRONN (CONT’D) 
             What are you waiting for, a kiss? 
        01:33:50:04  BRONN (CONT’D) 
                Ready the lady's horse. 
             Podrick walks to the horses. 
         
        01:34:01:24  
           Jaime looks down at Brienne’s sword in its 
           sheath. 
                      JAIME 
            They say the best swords have names. 
        01:34:04:08   JAIME 
                    Any ideas? 
        01:34:11:16  BRIENNE 
                    Oathkeeper. 
             Jaime nods. 
              
              
        01:34:25:08  
                       57 
                      JAIME 
                  Good-bye, Brienne. 
             Brienne leaves.

             Brienne and Podrick ride away. 
                     PODRICK 
                   Come on, move. 
                        
             Brienne looks back at Jaime.

             INT. CASTLE LIBRARY – NIGHT. 
                     SAM (OS) 
             I should never have taken her away. 
        01:35:19:21  JON (OS) 
                 She wasn't safe here. 
                        
                        
                      SAM 
                She's not safe out there. 
        01:35:22:24  SAM (CONT’D) 
                 I should have known. 
        01:35:24:20  SAM (CONT’D) 
             You told us there were wildlings 
                  south of the Wall. 
        01:35:26:20   SAM (CONT’D - OS) 
           If they're raiding the smaller villages,  
               Mole's Town could be next. 
        01:35:29:20   JON 
                       58 
               Castle Black could be next. 
                        
                      SAM 
               I should go back for Gilly. 
        01:35:32:29  JON (OS) 
                   We have orders.  
              No one's to leave the castle. 
        01:35:34:15   SAM 
            I remember when you disobeyed orders 
               and rode south to help Robb. 
        01:35:37:04   JON 
             And I remember who came after me 
                  and brought me home. 
        01:35:41:27  JON (CONT”D) 
           I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. 
        01:35:46:29  JON (CONT”D) 
               When you told me about Bran 
                 going beyond the Wall, 
        01:35:49:27  JON (CONT”D) 
         all I could think about was getting my strength 
             back so I could go and find him. 
        01:35:54:09     
                      SAM 
             I wish I could have convinced him 
                  to come back with me. 
        01:35:58:16  SAM (CONT’D) 
                I tried. Really, I did. 
        01:36:03:20   JON 
               How fast could they travel? 
                       59 
        01:36:05:29  JON (CONT’D) 
                 A crippled boy being  
             pulled on a sledge by a simpleton? 
        01:36:09:15  SAM (OS) 
                   I don't know. 
        01:36:11:02   SAM (CONT’D - OS) 
              They'd pass wildling villages. 
        01:36:13:10   SAM (CONT’D - OS) 
              They could try to find shelter 
                   at one of them. 
        01:36:17:29   JON 
           The wildlings have joined up with Mance. 
        01:36:20:24  JON (CONT’D) 
             Every village or sheltered place 
                  will be deserted. 
                        
           Sam walks over to stand next to Jon and look 
           at the map. 
        01:36:27:13  JON (CONT’D) 
                     Except... 
                        
             Locke walks in without being seen. 
        01:36:32:21   JON (CONT’D – OS) 
                    Craster's? 
        01:36:35:02  SAM (CONT’D) 
             You think Bran might have found-- 
        01:36:37:14   LOCKE 
                      Snow. 
                       60 
                        
             Jon and Sam turn to look at Locke. 
        01:36:39:27  LOCKE (CONT’D) 
               I don't mean to interrupt. 
        01:36:41:18  LOCKE (CONT’D) 
                Thorne wants to see you. 
             Locke exits.

              Your foray to Craster's Keep, 
        01:36:50:13   ALLISER (CONT’D) 
                  I'll sanction it. 
        01:36:52:13  
                 ALLISER (CONT’D - OS) 
           But I won't order anyone to go with you. 
        01:36:56:11 ALLISER (CONT’D) 
                  Volunteers only. 
        01:36:59:01   JON

             Jon walks toward the men to address them. 
        01:37:11:13  JON (CONT’D) 
                   Ahem, brothers. 
        01:37:13:26

             The men look at Jon. 
              
              
        01:37:25:06  JON (CONT’D) 
                  I'm going beyond the Wall 
                    to Craster's Keep. 
        01:37:28:00   JON (CONT’D - OS) 
             I'm going to capture the mutineers 
               holed up there or kill them. 
        01:37:32:12   JON (CONT’D - OS) 
          I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. 
        01:37:36:24  JON (CONT’D) 
              There's 60 miles of wilderness 
                between here and Craster's 
        01:37:39:18  JON (CONT’D) 
               and Mance Rayder has an army 
                  bearing down on us, 
        01:37:42:16  JON (CONT’D) 
                but we have to do this. 
        01:37:44:23   JON (CONT’D - OS) 
               Our survival may depend on 
        01:37:47:28   JON (CONT’D - OS) 
              us getting to these mutineers 
                  before Mance does. 
        01:37:50:21  JON (CONT’D) 
                 They know the Wall.  
                       62 
                They know our defenses. 
        01:37:54:13  JON (CONT’D) 
              If Mance learns what they know,  
                    we're lost. 
        01:37:59:29  JON (CONT’D) 
                But if that's not enough, 
        01:38:02:12  JON (CONT’D) 
                 then consider this. 
        01:38:04:29   JON (CONT’D - OS) 
           If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, 
        01:38:07:09  JON (CONT’D) 
          then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. 
        01:38:11:17  JON (CONT’D) 
              He lived and died for the Watch 
        01:38:13:19  JON (CONT’D) 
             and he was betrayed by his own men. 
        01:38:16:03  JON (CONT’D) 
              Stabbed in the back by cowards. 
         
        01:38:17:25   JON (CONT’D - OS) 
                He deserved far better.

                 put his wolf in a cage?

                 They might have been  
             Night's Watch once, not anymore. 
        01:47:40:19   MEERA 
             We're not safe here. We need to go. 
        01:47:42:14   BRAN 
                      No. 
        01:47:44:01   MEERA 
                Bran, we need to go now. 
        01:47:46:14   BRAN 
              I'm not leaving without Summer. 
        01:47:55:05   MEERA 
            Can you remember where the cage was? 
        01:47:56:24   BRAN 
               The east side of the keep. 
                        
             Meera gets up and walks to free the wolf. 
         
        01:48:01:26   MEERA 
             If I'm not back soon, we'll meet— 
                        
           Meera is struck down by a man with a sword. 
        01:48:04:26  
                       75 
             Hodor stands up. Men stand around looking 
             down at Meera laying on the ground. 
                        
                      HODOR 
                     Hodor. 
        01:48:15:04  
             (shouting) 
             Hodor is chained up inside the encampment. 
             Men with swords surround Hodor shouting at 
             him and threatening him. 
         
        01:48:20:08  HODOR (CONT’D) 
                     Hodor. 
        01:48:25:00  HODOR (CONT’D) 
                     Hodor. 
             The men stick Hodor with their swords. 
        01:48:26:23  
             (groans) 
              
             Hodor falls to the ground. 
              
              
        01:48:29:28   HODOR 
                     Hodor. 
        01:48:33:00   RAST 
                 If I was your size,  
             I'd be king of the fucking world. 
           Rast walks away and leaves Hodor on the 
           ground.

                      KARL 
                    Help him up. 
                        
             A man throws Bran into sitting position. 
             Karl gets up and walks over to Bran. 
         
        01:49:12:11 
             Karl inspects Bran’s clothing.   
                        
                   KARL (CONT’D) 
                   This is nice. 
        01:49:15:20  KARL (CONT’D) 
                   Fine leather. 
        01:49:19:11  KARL (CONT’D) 
                 You're no wildling. 
        01:49:21:13  KARL (CONT’D) 
                 Important. Highborn. 
        01:49:26:08  KARL (CONT’D) 
                    Who are you? 
             Bran says nothing and Karl stands up and 
             slaps him in the face. 
         
        01:49:36:08  
             (grunts) 
         
        01:49:37:25  KARL (CONT’D) 
               You see, where I come from, 
        01:49:39:16  KARL (CONT’D) 
                a commoner like me slaps 
                 a little lord like you, 
                       77 
         
        01:49:42:01  KARL (CONT’D) 
                I'd lose my right hand. 
         
        01:49:44:11  KARL (CONT’D) 
                 But we're a long way  
                 from home, aren't we? 
        01:49:49:23  KARL (CONT’D) 
                 And the two of you, 
        01:49:51:27  KARL (CONT’D) 
            fancy-looking folks north of the Wall 
        01:49:55:15  KARL (CONT’D) 
               creeping through the woods. 
         
        01:49:58:28  KARL (CONT’D) 
                 Isn't that a bit odd? 
        01:50:04:21  KARL (CONT’D) 
                I like your curly hair. 
             Karl runs his hands over Meera’s hair and 
             grabs hold of her head. 
         
        01:50:08:19  KARL (CONT’D) 
               My mom had curls like that. 
        01:50:11:26  KARL (CONT’D) 
                 Beautiful brown curls. 
        01:50:16:12  KARL (CONT’D) 
              Why'd you drag a crippled boy 
                  all the way up here? 
                       78 
                        
             Karl releases Meera.  
        01:50:24:27  KARL (CONT’D) 
           See you haven't played this game before. 
        01:50:28:14  KARL (CONT’D - OS) 
                 A highborn hostage, 
        01:50:30:26  KARL (CONT’D - OS) 
                  that's valuable. 
        01:50:33:23  KARL (CONT’D - OS) 
                  But three of them, 
        01:50:36:09  KARL (CONT’D) 
              that's a lot of mouths to feed. 
             Karl draws his dagger. 
        01:50:40:19  
             Jojen falls to the ground convulsing. 
                        
                      RAST 
              What the fuck's wrong with him?  
             Meera goes to Jojen’s side. Karl grabs her 
             and puts his dagger to her throat. 
                      KARL 
                    Come here. 
        01:50:42:16  
             (screams) MEERA 
                    No, please. 
        01:50:44:19  MEERA (CONT’D) 
             Please. Please, let me help him.

                       79 
                     KARL (OS) 
                    Who are you? 
                        
                      MEERA 
                     Please. 
        01:50:48:03   KARL 
                    Who are you? 
                      BRAN 
        01:50:51:14  I'm Brandon Stark! 
                   BRAN (CONT’D) 
             I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell. 
             Rast enters and Karl lets go of Meera. 
             Rast looks at Bran then to Karl. 
              
              
        01:50:56:10   RAST 
                It's Jon Snow's brother. 
        01:51:00:21  
             Meera goes to Jojen’s side. 
                      MEERA 
                It's Meera. It's Meera.  
                   I'm right here. 
        01:51:03:03   KARL 
                 And I thought this was  
               gonna be another boring day. 
                        
             Karl puts his dagger in its sheath. 
         
        01:51:12:23   MEERA
