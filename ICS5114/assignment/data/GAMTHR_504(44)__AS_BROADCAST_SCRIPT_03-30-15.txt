           A small boat is in shallow water. A man gets out and lifts something from the boat. He carries the 
           object to shore.

           A man's fist enters from right and punches the boatman in the face. He falls.

           A knife sinks into a canvas target. Jaime is below decks with Bronn. 
                          BRONN 
                     Why are we on a merchant ship?

                       Why no Lannister sails?

                      This ship's sailing to Oldtown.

                   We'll get off earlier not far from Sunspear,

                  row ourselves to the Dornish shore in the night. 
                         
    01:03:39:00   
                          BRONN 
                       You ever been to Dorne? 
                         
    01:03:40:23   
                           JAIME 
                           No. 
                          BRONN 
                           I have.

                       The Dornish are crazy.

                        BRONN (CONT'D) 
                  All they want to do is fight and fuck, fuck and fight. 
                         
    01:03:47:17   
                           JAIME 
                     You should be happy to go back. 
                         
           Jaime takes a drink. Bronn stands. 
                         
    01:03:50:24 
                          BRONN 
                     There's nothing like a good fight 
                         
    01:03:52:14 
                         
                        BRONN (CONT'D) 
                     to get you in the mood for fucking. 
           Bronn walks to the target and pulls out the knife. 
        
                         
    01:03:54:24 
                         
                        BRONN  (CONT'D) 
                  And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl 
                         
    01:03:56:28 
                         
                        BRONN  (CONT'D) 
                     to clear your head for the next fight. 
                         
           Bronn sits again. 
                         
    01:03:59:08          
                         
                        BRONN  (CONT'D) 
                     It's how the two work together. 
                                       
    01:04:01:15                        
                        BRONN  (CONT'D) 
                 Now we're gonna be doing a lot of fighting, I'm sure. 
                                       
    01:04:03:21                        
                        BRONN  (CONT'D) 
                          Well, I am. 
                         
           Jaime listens. 
                         
    01:04:05:13          
                         
                        BRONN  (CONT'D) 
                 But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. 
                         
    01:04:08:04 
                         
                        BRONN  (CONT'D) 
                   Not after we've kidnapped their princess. 
                         
           Bronn wipes his knife. 
                         
    01:04:10:06          
                           JAIME 
                     We're not kidnapping their princess.

                We're rescuing my niece, bringing her back to her family. 
                                       
    01:04:15:07                        
                          BRONN 
                          Your niece? 
                         
           Jaime and Bronn stare at each other. Bronn takes a drink. 
                         
    01:04:24:20 
                         
                        BRONN (CONT'D) 
                   I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. 
                         
    01:04:27:03   
                         
                        BRONN (CONT'D) 
                         I'm good at it. 
                           JAIME 
                       That's why you're here. 
                         
    01:04:29:01   
                          BRONN 
                      I know. Why are you here? 
                         
    01:04:31:13   
                         
                        BRONN (CONT'D) 
                    Why not send 40 of me? Or an army? 
                         
    01:04:33:20   
                         
                        BRONN (CONT'D) 
                   Unlike most folks, you've actually got one. 
                         
    01:04:36:05   
                           JAIME 
                     Because I don't want to start a war. 
                         
    01:04:39:03   
                          BRONN 
                  That still doesn't explain what you're doing here. 
                         
    01:04:45:06 
                           JAIME 
                         It has to be me. 
                         
    01:04:49:20   
                          BRONN 
                   If I'm putting something like this together, 
                         
    01:04:52:17   
                         
                        BRONN (CONT'D) 
                    a one-handed man who happens to be 
                         
    01:04:54:16   
                         
                        BRONN (CONT'D) 
                 one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros is not-- 
                         
    01:04:57:06   
                           JAIME 
                         It has to be me. 
                         
    01:05:04:07   
                          BRONN 
                    You set your brother free, didn't you? 
                         
           Jaime looks up; he does not meet Bronn's eyes. 
                         
    01:05:08:22 
                         
                        BRONN (CONT'D) 
                     I'll bet your sister didn't like that.

                        Varys set him free.

                         I-I don't know. 
                         
    01:12:00:11   
                         
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                        I-I didn't order it. 
                         
    01:12:02:02   
                          MARGAERY 
                       We both know who did. 
                         
    01:12:04:16   
                         
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                  You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock. 
                         
    01:12:08:13 
                         
           Tommen stands. He faces her. 
                         
                          TOMMEN 
                    Are you saying my mother's behind this? 
                         
    01:12:10:25   
                          MARGAERY 
                    She's jealous you're not hers anymore. 
                         
    01:12:13:11   
                         
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                     Arresting my brother is her revenge. 
                         
    01:12:16:08   
                          TOMMEN 
                    Aren't you and Mother getting along? 
                         
    01:12:18:11 
                         
           Margaery turns away in exasperation. 
                          MARGAERY 
                          ( huffs ) 
    01:12:24:03 
                         
           Margaery sits near Tommen. Her tone is much more gentle. 
                         
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                       Oh, my sweet, sweet king. 
                         
    01:12:29:14   
                         
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                    Do you have any affection for me at all? 
                         
    01:12:34:03 
                         
           Tommen takes her hand. 
                         
                          TOMMEN 
                         Of course I do. 
                                       
    01:12:36:04                        
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                        You're my queen. 
                                       
    01:12:38:03                        
                          MARGAERY 
                     I can't bear to think of my brother 
                                       
    01:12:40:13                        
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                     locked away in some grimy cell. 
                                       
    01:12:45:09                        
                          TOMMEN 
                       I'll set him free for you. 
                                       
    01:12:47:19                        
                          MARGAERY 
                        Do you promise? 
                         
    01:12:56:02 
                         
           INT. CHAMBER OF THE HAND OFFICE - LATER 
                         
           Tommen bursts through the chamber doors. He walks to where Cersei is standing at the window, 
           drinking wine. 
                         
                          TOMMEN 
                    I demand that Ser Loras be freed now. 
                         
    01:12:58:20 
                         
           Cersei turns to him. 
                         
                           CERSEI 
                         Did I arrest him? 
                         
    01:13:02:01 
                         
           Tommen sounds uncertain. 
                         
                          TOMMEN 
                          Well, no. 
                         
    01:13:04:13   
                         
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                     But y-you armed the Faith Militant. 
                         
    01:13:06:27   
                         
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                     You gave the High Sparrow an army. 
                         
    01:13:10:11   
                           CERSEI 
                           I did. 
                         
    01:13:12:24   
                         
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                    And your wife has every right to criticize. 
                         
    01:13:16:27   
                         
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                 We can't allow fanatics to arrest the queen's brother 
                         
    01:13:19:17   
                         
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                       no matter his perversions. 
                         
           Cersei walks to her desk and sits. 
                         
    01:13:22:05 
                          TOMMEN 
                           Then... 
    01:13:25:16                        
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                  can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released? 
                                       
    01:13:28:05                        
                           CERSEI 
                     I told you, I'm not holding Ser Loras. 
                                       
    01:13:30:25                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                         You're the king. 
                                       
    01:13:32:25                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, 
                                       
    01:13:34:20                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                       he'll release the poor boy. 
                         
    01:13:41:27 
                         
           EXT. SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY 
                         
                         
           Tommen's litter is carried, attended by guards. 
                          GUARD 
                           Halt! 
                         
           The litter bearers stop and Tommen gets out. He walks up the steps, followed by his guards.  
                         
    01:13:50:27 
                         
           ( coughing, chatter ) 
                         
    01:14:06:14          
                         
           Halfway up, the steps are blocked by Faith Militants. 
                         FAITH MILITANT 
                  His Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed. 
    01:14:11:19 
                         KINGSGUARD 
                   Give the order and we'll clear out this rabble. 
                         
    01:14:16:05   
                          TOMMEN 
                        You mean, kill them? 
                         
    01:14:19:01   
                         
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                        Here at the sept? 
                         
    01:14:21:02   
                         KINGSGUARD 
                 You'd be sending them to meet the gods that they love. 
                         
    01:14:27:09   
                          MAN - OS     
                          Bastard! 
                         
           Tommen turns toward the voice, which comes from behind him. 
                         
    01:14:29:05 
                         MAN #2 - OS 
                       You're an abomination! 
                         
           A scan of the crowd shows nothing. Tommen turns back to the Faith Militant. 
                         
    01:14:36:12 
                         MAN #3 - OS 
                          Born of sin! 
                         
           Tommen turns and looks behind him again. 
                         
    01:14:38:22 
                         WOMAN - OS 
                         Filthy bastard! 
                         
    01:14:45:21 
                         
           Tommen looks back at the Faith Militant. 
                         
                          TOMMEN 
                       We'll find another way. 
                         
           Tommen turns and walks down the stairs, his guards behind him. 
                         
    01:14:50:00 
                         MAN #4 - OS

           INT. TOMMEN'S CHAMBER - DAY 
                         
           Tommen enters and looks around. 
                          TOMMEN 
                          My queen? 
                         
    01:15:04:17 
                         
           Margaery walks forward. 
                         
                         
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                 There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence. 
                                       
    01:15:10:07                        
                          MARGAERY 
                      You're the King of the Andals,

                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                and you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.

                          TOMMEN 
                   I'm going to speak with the High Sparrow. 
                                       
    01:15:23:01

                         Are you? When? 
                         
    01:15:26:15 
                         
           Tommen's voice is very quiet. 
                         
                          TOMMEN 
                         I-I don't know. 
                          MARGAERY     
                         You don't know?

                          TOMMEN 
                       He was praying just now. 
                                       
    01:15:34:16                        
                          MARGAERY 
                    I have to send word to Grandmother. 
                         
           She walks past Tommen, to the door. 
                         
    01:15:37:18 
                          TOMMEN 
                       Will you come back later? 
                         
    01:15:41:11 
                         
           Margaery pauses. 
                         
                          MARGAERY 
                    I need to be with my family, Your Grace. 
                         
    01:15:45:11 
                         
           Margaery walks away. 
                         
                         
                          TOMMEN 
                          Of course. 
                         
    01:15:48:02 
                         
           EXT. CASTLE BLACK - CATWALK - DAY 
                         
           In the courtyard, two men in armor are sparring. 
                         
           ( grunting ) 
                         
    01:15:50:01          
                          SELYSE - OS 
                      You think highly of this boy? 
                         
    01:15:51:24 
                         
           The men pause, and Jon Snow walks up to them. 
                           JON 
                           Good. 
                         
    01:15:53:10   
                         STANNIS - OS 
                    Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. 
                         
           Stannis leans on the catwalk railing, watching, while Selyse stands near him. 
                         
    01:15:55:09   
                           SELYSE 
                     And a bastard by some tavern slut. 
                         
    01:15:58:03   
                          STANNIS 
                   Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way. 
                         
           Jon is now sparring with one of the men. 
                         
    01:16:04:25 
                           SELYSE 
                      I should have given you a son. 
                         
                         
    01:16:08:20 
                          STANNIS      
                         Not your fault. 
                                       
    01:16:10:09                        
                           SELYSE 
                         Whose, then? 
                                       
    01:16:12:10                        
                         SELYSE (CONT'D) 
                     I gave you nothing but weakness. 
                         
           Selyse looks across the courtyard and sees Shireen Baratheon sitting and watching the sparring. 
                         
    01:16:17:18 
                         
                         SELYSE (CONT'D) 
                         And deformity. 
                         
    01:16:20:16 
                         MELISANDRE 
                  Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light. 
                         
           Selyse turns to see Melisandre walking toward them. 
                         
    01:16:23:07 
                           SELYSE 
                          My lady. 
                                       
    01:16:25:09                        
                         MELISANDRE 
                     Her father is the Lord's chosen king, 
                                       
    01:16:28:01                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   and her father's blood runs through her veins. 
                         
           Selyse nods and leaves. 
                         
    01:16:39:17          
                         
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                      You march on Winterfell soon? 
    01:16:42:02 
                          STANNIS 
                      We must to beat the snows. 
                                       
    01:16:46:12                        
                         MELISANDRE 
                   Once before, you put your faith in Ser Davos 
                                       
    01:16:49:02                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                        and left me behind. 
                                       
    01:16:53:18                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   I hope you won't make that mistake again. 
                                       
    01:16:55:21                        
                          STANNIS 
                          I won't. 
                                       
    01:16:59:23                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                          I need you. 
                                       
    01:17:01:19                        
                         MELISANDRE 
                      You only need faith, my king. 
                                       
    01:17:08:18                        
                          STANNIS 
                    And you, my lady, what do you need? 
                                       
    01:17:12:09                        
                         MELISANDRE 
                        To serve my Lord. 
                         
    01:17:15:08 
                         
           Jon and the other man are still sparring. 
                         
           ( grunting ) 
                         
                         
    01:17:19:07 
                         
           INT. CASTLE BLACK - JON'S CHAMBERS - LATER THAT DAY 
                         
           Sam put papers in front of Jon, one after the other, as Jon sits at his desk. Jon signs each paper. 
                           SAM 
                         Lord Ashford. 
                         
    01:17:26:08   
                          SAM (CONT'D) 
                         Lady Caulfield. 
                         
    01:17:30:06   
                          SAM (CONT'D) 
                        Oh, Lord Smallwood. 
                         
    01:17:33:11   
                           JON 
                    I've never even heard of these people. 
                         
    01:17:35:07   
                           SAM 
                     They haven't heard of you, either. 
                         
    01:17:37:21   
                          SAM (CONT'D) 
                    But we need men and they have some. 
                         
    01:17:42:10   
                           JON 
                How many men does this Lord Mayzen have to send us? 
                         
    01:17:45:10   
                           SAM 
                      More than Lord Wibberley. 
                         
    01:18:01:05 
                         
           Sam puts another paper in front of Jon. Jon pauses. 
                           JON 
                          Not him. 
                           SAM 
                        I know, I'm sorry. 
                         
    01:18:03:17   
                          SAM (CONT'D) 
                      But we need men and supplies 
                         
    01:18:05:26   
                          SAM (CONT'D) 
                   and Roose Bolton's the Warden of the North. 
                         
    01:18:07:13   
                           JON 
                       He murdered my brother. 
                         
    01:18:08:25   
                           SAM 
                   We swore to be the watchers on the Wall. 
                         
    01:18:12:04   
                          SAM (CONT'D) 
                    We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. 
                         
    01:18:15:19   
                          SAM (CONT'D) 
                      And we can't get more men 
                         
    01:18:17:15   
                          SAM (CONT'D) 
                   without help from the Warden of the North. 
                         
           Jon hesitates, then signs the paper. He throws down his pen and pushes back his chair. Sam picks up 
           the papers. As he leaves, Melisandre enters. 
                         
    01:18:42:15 
                          SAM (CONT'D) 
                        Apologies, my lady. 
                         
    01:18:52:13 
                         
           Sam looks at Jon. Jon nods, and Sam exits. 
                         
           ( door closes ) 
                         
                         
    01:18:56:14   
                         MELISANDRE 
                        Lord Commander. 
                         
    01:18:58:11   
                           JON 
                        How can I help you? 
                         
    01:19:00:28   
                         MELISANDRE 
                     Come with us when we ride south. 
                         
           Melisandre approaches Jon's desk. 
                         
    01:19:03:03                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   None of us know the castle as well as you do. 
                                       
    01:19:06:11                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                     Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, 
                                       
    01:19:08:28                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                          its people. 
                                       
    01:19:11:17                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                     Winterfell was your home once. 
                                       
    01:19:15:09                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   Don't you want to chase the rats out of it?

                      Castle Black is my home now. 
                         
                         
    01:19:23:00 
                         JON (CONT'D) 
              The Night's Watch take no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms. 
                         
    01:19:26:18   
                         MELISANDRE 
                        There's only one war. 
                         
    01:19:28:19   
                         
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                        Life against death. 
                         
    01:19:32:18   
                         
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                  Come, let me show you what you're fighting for. 
                         
    01:19:36:00   
                           JON 
                  You're gonna show me some vision in the fire? 
                         
    01:19:38:23   
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                   Forgive me, my lady, I don't trust in visions. 
                         
    01:19:43:16   
                         MELISANDRE 
                        No visions. No magic. 
                         
    01:19:47:03   
                         
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                          Just life. 
                         
           Melisandre opens her robe. She takes Jon's hand and places it on her breast. 
                         
    01:20:08:22 
                         
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                      Do you feel my heart beating? 
                         
           Jon nods. 
                         
                         
                         
    01:20:13:21 
                         
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                        There's power in you. 
                                       
    01:20:15:28                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                    You resist it, and that's your mistake. 
                                       
    01:20:18:24                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                          Embrace it. 
                         
           Jon pulls his hand away. Melisandre smiles. 
                         
    01:20:30:13 
                         
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   The Lord of Light made us male and female. 
                         
           Melisandre sits on Jon's lap. 
                         
    01:20:34:18                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                      Two parts of a greater whole. 
                                       
    01:20:38:02                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                      In our joining, there's power. 
                                       
    01:20:41:28                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                        Power to make life, 
                                       
    01:20:44:14                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                        power to make light, 
                                       
    01:20:46:26                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                      and power to cast shadows. 
                                       
                                       
    01:20:49:25                        
                           JON 
                  I don't think Stannis would like that very much. 
                         
    01:20:53:27 
                         MELISANDRE 
                      Then we shouldn't tell him. 
                         
    01:20:57:07   
                           JON 
                           I can't. 
                         MELISANDRE 
                           Why? 
                         
    01:21:00:18   
                           JON 
                         I swore a vow. 
                         
    01:21:04:10   
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                         I loved another. 
    01:21:06:21   
                         MELISANDRE 
                      The dead don't need lovers. 
                         
    01:21:09:00   
                         
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                         Only the living. 
                         
           Jon pushes away her hand. 
                         
    01:21:15:22          
                           JON 
                          I know. 
                         
    01:21:18:17 
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                        But I still love her. 
                         
                                       
                         
    01:21:35:07 
                         
           Melisandre stands and walks to the door. She pauses in the doorway. 
                         MELISANDRE 
                      You know nothing, Jon Snow. 
                         
           Melisandre leaves. 
                         
    01:21:51:10          
                         
           INT. STANNIS'S CHAMBERS - DAY 
                         
           Stannis sits at his desk, reading a paper. 
                         
           ( knocks on door ) 
                         
                         
           Shireen enters. She begins to looks around quietly. 
                         
    01:22:15:02 
                          STANNIS      
                         Are you lonely? 
                         
    01:22:18:02   
                          SHIREEN 
                          Just bored. 
                         
    01:22:19:16   
                          STANNIS 
                    My father used to tell me that boredom 
                         
    01:22:21:07   
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                     indicates a lack of inner resources. 
                         
    01:22:22:28   
                          SHIREEN 
                      Were you bored a lot, too? 
                         
    01:22:24:19 
                          STANNIS      
                        I know Castle Black 
    01:22:27:06 
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                      is no place for a child, but-- 
                                       
    01:22:28:23                        
                          SHIREEN 
                    I like it. I thought I'd be left at home. 
                                       
    01:22:32:08                        
                        SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                    I know Mother didn't want to bring me. 
                                       
    01:22:34:26                        
                          STANNIS 
                        Why do you say that? 
                                       
    01:22:38:06                        
                          SHIREEN 
                    She told me, I don't want to bring you. 
                         
    01:22:42:14 
                         
           Stannis does not look up from his piece of paper. 
                          STANNIS 
                      She shouldn't have said that. 
                                       
    01:22:54:05                        
                          SHIREEN 
                     Are you ashamed of me, Father? 
                         
           Stannis puts aside his paper. 
                         
    01:23:07:18          
                          STANNIS 
                       When you were an infant, 
                         
    01:23:10:08 
                         
           Stannis stands. 
                         
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                    a Dornish trader landed on Dragonstone. 
    01:23:13:26 
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                  His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. 
                         
    01:23:18:22 
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                He had even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our house. 
                         
    01:23:23:29 
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                    No doubt he had heard of your birth 
                         
    01:23:26:08 
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   and assumed new fathers were easy targets. 
                         
    01:23:33:01 
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
              I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle. 
                         
    01:23:37:24 
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                     How you pressed it to your cheek. 
                         
    01:23:47:06 
                         
           Stannis and Shireen look quietly at each other for a moment. 
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                  By the time we burned the doll, it was too late. 
                                       
    01:23:52:10                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                       I was told you would die. 
                                       
    01:23:54:18                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                          Or worse, 
                                       
    01:23:57:19                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                      the greyscale would go slow. 
    01:23:59:21   
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   Let you grow just enough to know the world 
                         
    01:24:02:26   
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                      before taking it away from you. 
                         
    01:24:04:29   
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                 Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria 
                         
    01:24:07:21   
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   to live out your short life with the Stone Men 
                         
    01:24:09:27   
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   before the sickness spread through the castle. 
                         
    01:24:14:07   
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                      I told them all to go to hell. 
                         
           Shireen smiles. 
                         
    01:24:18:11          
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                  I called in every maester on this side of the world. 
                         
    01:24:21:12

                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   They stopped the disease and saved your life. 
                         
    01:24:29:29 
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   Cause you did not belong across the world 
    01:24:31:26                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                      with the bloody Stone Men. 
                                       
    01:24:34:23                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                  You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. 
                         
           Stannis turns to face Shireen. He speaks quietly but passionately. 
                         
    01:24:40:04 
                         
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                       And you are my daughter. 
                         
           Shireen smiles and hugs him. He puts his arms around her.

           A hand lights a candle. Sansa's face becomes visible. She carries the candle and places it in the hand 
           of a statue of Lyanna Stark. 
                         
           ( water dripping ) 
                         
                         
           Sansa picks up a feather from the floor and blows dust from it. 
                         
    01:25:43:13

                      I thought I might find you here. 
                         
           Sansa jumps. 
                         
    01:25:48:07          
                         
                      LITTLEFINGER - OS (CONT'D) 
                        Your Aunt Lyanna. 
                         
           Sansa looks at the statue as Littlefinger approaches. 
                         
    01:25:50:08 
                           SANSA 
                      Father never talked about her. 
                                       
    01:25:54:23                        
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                 Sometimes I'd find him down here lighting the candles. 
                                       
    01:25:59:03                        
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                      They say she was beautiful.

                         I saw her once.

                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                   I was a boy living with your mother's family.

                    She was already promised to Robert.

                    The last two riders were Barristan Selmy 
                         
    01:26:35:02   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                       and Rhaegar Targaryen. 
                         
    01:26:37:04   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                 When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for their prince. 
                         
    01:26:40:27   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet 
                         
    01:26:42:27   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                      and they saw that silver hair. 
                         
    01:26:44:29   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                       How handsome he was. 
                         
                         
    01:26:47:11   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                     Until he rode right past his wife, 
                         
    01:26:50:06

    01:26:52:07   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                       and all the smiles died. 
                         
    01:26:55:12

                    I've never seen so many people so quiet. 
                         
    01:26:58:26   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                        He rode past his wife 
                         
    01:27:02:11   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                  and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. 
                         
    01:27:06:09

           Littlefinger looks at the statue. 
                         
    01:27:11:22          
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                    How many tens of thousands had to die 
                         
    01:27:13:27   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                     because Rhaegar chose your aunt? 
                         
    01:27:18:07   
                           SANSA 
                        Yes, he chose her.

                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                   And then he kidnapped her and raped her. 
                         
    01:27:31:22 
                         
           Littlefinger looks at her and smiles slightly. He puts a hand on her arm. 
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                           Come.

           Sansa and Littlefinger walk down a passageway of the crypt. 
                           SANSA 
                       You're dressed for riding.

                         King's Landing. 
                         
    01:27:49:17 
                         
           Sansa's tone is disbelieving. 
                         
                           SANSA 
                         King's Landing?

                        Cersei sent for me. 
                         
    01:27:53:13   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                    We mustn't let her sniff out any trouble. 
                         
    01:27:56:02   
                           SANSA 
                       You can't leave me here. 
                         
    01:27:57:27   
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                 I know how hard it is to live with people you despise. 
                         
    01:28:00:13   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                          Believe me. 
                         
    01:28:02:04   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                       But it won't be for long. 
                         
    01:28:04:03   
                           SANSA 
                        How do you know? 
                         
    01:28:07:01 
                         
           They begin walking again. 
                         
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                   Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. 
                         
    01:28:10:09   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                     He'll march south to King's Landing 
                         
                         
    01:28:12:20   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                    before the winter snows block his way. 
                         
    01:28:14:20   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                     But first he has to take Winterfell. 
                         
    01:28:17:23   
                           SANSA 
                        You don't know that. 
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                           I do. 
                         
    01:28:21:14   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                  Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons, 
                         
    01:28:23:19   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                  he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. 
                         
    01:28:26:02   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                      With the North behind him, 
                         
    01:28:28:03   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                    Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne. 
                         
    01:28:30:20   
                           SANSA 
                     You think he'll defeat the Boltons? 
                         
    01:28:33:13   
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                        He has a larger army. 
                         
                         
                         
    01:28:35:03   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                  He's the finest military commander in Westeros. 
                         
    01:28:37:24 
                         
           Again, Littlefinger stops and looks into Sansa's face as he speaks. 
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                  A betting man would put his money on Stannis. 
                         
    01:28:41:11   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                     As it happens, I am a betting man. 
                         
    01:28:45:10   
                           SANSA 
                        And if you're right? 
                         
    01:28:47:03   
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                       Stannis takes Winterfell, 
                         
    01:28:49:06   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. 
                         
    01:28:52:07   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
               Grateful for your late father's courageous support of his claim, 
                         
    01:28:55:13   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                    he names you Wardeness of the North. 
                         
    01:28:58:00 
                         
           Sansa sounds shocked. 
                         
                           SANSA 
                           But I-- 
                         
                         
                         
    01:29:00:14 
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                          I wouldn't-- 
                         
    01:29:02:03   
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                       Wardeness of the North? 
                         
    01:29:03:23   
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                      You are the last surviving Stark. 
                         
    01:29:06:17   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                         He needs you. 
                         
    01:29:08:11   
                           SANSA 
                       And what if you're wrong? 
                         
    01:29:09:20   
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                    What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell? 
                         
    01:29:11:16   
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                    Or he does and the Boltons defeat him? 
                         
    01:29:14:01   
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                   Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, 
                         
    01:29:16:09   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                        and make him yours. 
                         
    01:29:18:04 
                         
           Sansa speaks quietly. 
                         
                         
                           SANSA 
                      I don't know how to do that. 
    01:29:19:27   
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                        Of course you do. 
                         
    01:29:21:21   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                      He's already fallen for you. 
                         
    01:29:23:18   
                           SANSA       
                       His father frightens me. 
                         
    01:29:25:19   
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                     He should. He's a dangerous man. 
                         
    01:29:29:04   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. 
                         
    01:29:33:00   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                 And you've learned to maneuver from the very best. 
                         
    01:29:37:24   
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                       I'll return before too long. 
                         
    01:29:40:12 
                         
           Littlefinger cups Sansa's head in his hand. 
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D)  
                      You'll be strong without me. 
                         
    01:29:50:26 
                         
           Sansa nods slightly. Littlefinger kisses her. 
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                       The North will be yours. 
    01:29:54:10 
                         
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                        Do you believe me? 
                         
    01:29:58:06   
                           SANSA 
                 I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return. 
                         
           Littlefinger smiles and walks away. 
                         
    01:30:03:15 
                         
           EXT. ROWBOAT - NIGHT 
                         
                         
           ( pats ) 
                         
                         
           Jaime and Bronn are in a rowboat on the water. Bronn is rowing, looking tired. He pauses and looks 
           at Jaime, who holds up his gold hand. Bronn continue rowing. 
                         
           Bronn and Jaime run through the shallows, pulling the rowboat onto the beach. 
                         
    01:30:41:03

           EXT. DORNISH BEACH - MORNING 
                         
           The sun is up. Jaime lies sleeping. He stirs and blinks. 
                         
    01:30:58:15

           Jaime sees Bronn standing over him with upraised knife. He throws it, and Jaime rolls to one side, to 
           see a snake next to him impaled on the knife. Bronn retrieves the knife. 
                         
    01:31:05:13 
                          BRONN 
                          Breakfast. 
                         
    01:31:11:04 
                         
           Jaime and Bronn sit in the sand in front of a fire. 
                        BRONN (CONT'D) 
                    That would have been a shit way to die. 
                                       
    01:31:13:04                        
                           JAIME 
                   As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die. 
                                       
    01:31:16:10                        
                          BRONN 
                Aye, but your lot have to give the singers a good ending. 
                                       
    01:31:19:23                        
                           JAIME 
                  I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead. 
                                       
    01:31:22:08

           Bronn puts his sword point-down in the sand. Then he takes out his knife and throws it into the 
           guard's throat.

           The other guards react. Bronn takes his sword. Fighting begins. Bronn kills another guard. 
                         
                        GUARD (CONT'D)

    01:34:42:28 
                         
           A third guard rides at Bronn. Bronn slashes his horse. 
                         
           ( horse neighs ) 
                         
                         
           The horse falls; the rider rolls off it. Bronn addresses Jaime, who stands with his sword in his left 
           hand. 
                         
    01:34:47:08

    01:34:54:24 
                         
           Bronn walks away. The guard runs at Jaime. They fight.

           Jaime falls. The guard attacks him. Jaime keeps falling and rolling down a sand dune, with the guard 
           after him. He catches the guard's sword in his gold hand. While the guard stands surprised, Jaime 
           picks up his own sword in his left hand and kills the guard. 
                         
    01:35:38:18 
                         
           Jaime removes his sword from the guard's body and kicks the guard down the hill.

           Jaime turns toward the sound of Bronn's voice. Bronn is standing on the hill above him.

                         TYRION - OS 
                      ( muffled ) Will you untie me? 
                         
           Jorah, at the tiller, ignores him. 
                         
    01:39:01:28 
                             
                       TYRION - OS (CONT'D) 
                    ( muffled ) Will you please untie me? 
                         
           Now Tyrion is visible, still tied and gagged. 
                         
                         
    01:39:04:27 
                         
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     ( muffled groan ) Will you please? 
                                       
    01:39:09:04                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                        ( muffled singing ) 
                         
           Jorah roughly removes Tyrion's gag. 
                         
    01:39:29:29 
                         
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                          Thank you. 
                         
    01:39:39:25 
                         
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                         Who are you? 
    01:39:41:22 
                           JORAH 
                         Your captor. 
                         
    01:39:45:11 
                          TYRION 
                        Do you have wine? 
                         
    01:39:47:03 
                           JORAH 
                           No. 
                         
    01:39:49:03 
                          TYRION 
                       Can't sleep without wine. 
                         
    01:39:51:00 
                         
           Jorah looks ahead, intent on steering. 
                           JORAH 
                        Then stay awake. 
                         
    01:39:58:20 
                         
           Tyrion looks around. 
                         
                          TYRION 
                      You're going the wrong way. 
                                       
    01:40:01:26                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       My sister is in Westeros. 
                         
    01:40:04:10 
                        TYRION (CONT'D)  
                        Westeros is west. 
                                       
    01:40:07:04                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                        We're heading east. 
                                       
    01:40:08:24                        
                           JORAH 
                     I'm not taking you to your sister. 
                                       
    01:40:12:23                        
                          TYRION 
                   You said you were taking me to the queen. 
                                       
    01:40:14:29                        
                           JORAH 
                     I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. 
                                       
    01:40:18:05                        
                         JORAH (CONT'D) 
                       She's the queen I serve. 
                                       
    01:40:19:28                        
                          TYRION 
                          ( laughing ) 
                                       
    01:40:26:15                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     What a waste of a good kidnapping. 
                                       
                                       
    01:40:29:26                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   It so happens I was heading there myself. 
                                       
    01:40:32:15                        
                           JORAH 
                  What business would you have with the queen? 
                                       
    01:40:34:20                        
                          TYRION 
                      Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. 
                                       
    01:40:38:06                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   If you'd ever met my sister, you'd understand. 
                         
    01:40:42:05 
                         
           Tyrion holds out his bound hands. 
                         
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                  So, Ŷow that it's clear we are oŶ the saŵe side… 
                         
           Jorah ignores him. Tyrion lets his hands fall. 
                         
    01:40:55:18                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                  A highborn knight from the North of Westeros 
                                       
    01:40:58:23                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       down on his luck in Essos. 
                                       
    01:41:01:10                        
           Tyrion looks at Jorah's things in the boat. 
                         
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                    Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate. 
                                       
    01:41:06:21                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       You're Jorah Mormont. 
           Jorah ignores him. 
                         
                         
    01:41:08:25 
                         
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                         I have to ask. 
                         
    01:41:11:20 
                         
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   How exactly were you serving your queen 
                                       
    01:41:13:27                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     in a whorehouse half a world away? 
                                       
    01:41:16:19                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     Is it possible that you were running? 
                                       
    01:41:19:08                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                      Why would you be running? 
                                       
    01:41:21:27                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                    And why would she have sent you away? 
                         
           Jorah makes no move except to steer. 
                         
    01:41:24:03 
                         
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                          Oh, wait. 
                                       
    01:41:27:09                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                    You were spying on her, weren't you? 
                                       
    01:41:30:21                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       It's all coming back to me. 
                                       
                                       
    01:41:32:13                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                I was drunk through most of the small council meetings, 
                                       
    01:41:34:23                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       but it's all coming back. 
                         
    01:41:36:16 
                         
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                    You passed notes to Varys's little birds. 
                                       
    01:41:40:12                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       She found out, didn't she? 
                                       
    01:41:43:21                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       Found out and exiled you. 
                                       
    01:41:47:03                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                  Now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. 
                                       
    01:41:51:25                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                         Risky scheme. 
                                       
    01:41:54:05                        
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                      One might even say desperate. 
                         
           Jorah remains impassive. 
                         
    01:41:58:09          
                         
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                 You think Daenerys will execute me and pardon you? 
                         
    01:42:03:07 
                         
                        TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     I'd say the reverse is just as likely. 
           Jorah comes forward and hits Tyrion across the face, knocking him to the floor of the boat. Then he 
           returns to his seat. 
                         
    01:42:24:10

    01:42:26:26          
                         
           Daenerys and Barristan stand on a turret, looking out over the city. 
                          DAENERYS 
                   Everyone looks happy enough from up here. 
                                       
    01:42:31:01

                          ( laughs ) 
                         
           Daenerys turns to him. 
                         
                          DAENERYS 
                           What?

                  I was thinking about all the times your brother 
                                       
    01:42:35:14                        
                        BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                  made me go with him down from the Red Keep 
                                       
    01:42:37:19                        
                        BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                     into the streets of King's Landing. 
                                       
    01:42:39:11                        
                          DAENERYS 
                           Why? 
                          BARRISTAN    
                     He liked to walk  among the people. 
                                       
    01:42:42:02                        
                        BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                       He liked to sing to them. 
                                       
    01:42:44:09                        
                          DAENERYS 
                        He sang to them? 
                                       
    01:42:45:27                        
                          BARRISTAN 
                           Yes. 
                          DAENERYS     
                          ( laughs ) 
           They turn and enter the castle.  
                         
    01:42:47:29 
                         
           INT.  DANYS'S PENTHOUSE - DAY 
                         
                        BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                    Rhaegar would pick a spot on the Hook 
                         
    01:42:50:09   
                         
                        BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                    or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. 
                         
    01:42:53:12   
                         
                        BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                      Just like all the other minstrels. 
                         
    01:42:54:27   
                          DAENERYS 
                       And what did you do? 
                         
    01:42:56:04   
                          BARRISTAN    
                      I made sure no one killed him. 
                         
    01:42:57:27   
                         
                        BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                      And I collected the money. 
    01:43:01:00 
                         
           Daenerys looks amazed. 
                         
                         
                        BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                  What? He liked to see how much he could make. 
                         
    01:43:03:12   
                          DAENERYS 
                         He was good? 
                          BARRISTAN 
                        He was very good. 
                         
    01:43:05:14   
                         
                        BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                       Viserys never told you? 
                         
    01:43:07:04   
                         
                        BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                  He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. 
                         
           Daenerys sits at the table. 
                         
    01:43:10:09          
                         
                        BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                      Rhaegar never liked killing. 
                         
    01:43:12:01   
                         
                        BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                        He loved singing. 
                         
    01:43:13:07   
                          DAENERYS 
                    And what did you do with the money? 
                         
    01:43:15:12   
                          BARRISTAN 
               Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street.

                        BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                 One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. 
                         
    01:43:21:06   
                         
                        BARRISTAN (CONT'D) 
                     One time, we got horribly drunk.

    01:43:29:01          
                         
                        DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                  Hizdahr is here, waiting in the audience chamber. 
                         
    01:43:32:22 
                         
           Daenerys stops smiling. Her tone becomes businesslike. 
                          DAENERYS 
                      How many others are there?

                    Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?

                          DAARIO 
                  I think I can protect you from Hizdahr zo Loraq. 
                         
                         
    01:43:43:10 
                         
           Daenerys speaks sternly. 
                         
                          DAENERYS 
                  I think I can protect me from Hizdahr zo Loraq. 
                         
    01:43:46:29 
                         
           Daenerys turns to Barristan. Her voice becomes tender. 
                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                        Go, Ser Barristan.

                           Glory?

                   Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea 
                         
    01:44:05:07   
                         
                        HIZDAHR (CONT'D)

                     I do not recognize this tradition.

           Hizdahr raises his voice slightly.

           A man wearing a mask of the gold harpy and carrying a torch hurries down the passage. Other men,
