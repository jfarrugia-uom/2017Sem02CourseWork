           EXT. BLACKWATER BAY - NIGHT 
            
           The prow of war ship cuts through the darkness.  In the 
           distance sits King's Landing. 
            
            
           EXT. BLACKWATER BAY - DAVOS SEAWORTH'S SHIP - NIGHT

           Davos and Matthos stand together on the deck. 
            
                          MATTHOS 
                   The tide's against us. 
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   Aye, but we have the wind.  She'll blow 
                   us straight to the gate. 
                    
                          MATTHOS 
                   You're coming home. 
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   King's Landing hasn’t been home for 
                   twenty years.  I spent most of my life 
                   dodging the royal fleet.  And now, I'm 
                   sailing right at them. 
                    
                          MATTHOS 
                   This is the royal fleet.  And you're not 
                   a smuggler anymore.  You're the High 
                   Captain. 
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   Of course, there are several royal 
                   fleets at the moment. 
                    
                          MATTHOS 
                   Not after tonight.  When the sun rises, 
                   Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and 
                   you will be his Hand.

                          MATTHOS 
                   God, father.  There's only one and he 
                   watches over us. 
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   But not over them? 
                    
                          MATTHOS 
                   Over all of us.  The people of King's 
                   Landing did not choose the False King 
                   Joffrey Baratheon.   They will be glad 
                   to see his head on a spike. 
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   But first, we have to put it there. 
                    
                          MATTHOS 
                   Our ships outnumber theirs ten to one.  
                   Our army outnumbers theirs five to one. 
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   Those walls have never been breached, 
                   and the men guarding the walls, when 
                   they see you, they won't see a 
                   liberator.  They see a stranger come to 
                   set their city on fire. 
                    
                          MATTHOS 
                   I have faith in the Lord of Light.  I 
                   have faith in our cause.  And I have 
                   faith in my Captain.

           Tyrion lies in bed next to Shae in the darkness.  He is wide 
           awake and contemplative.

                   If this city falls, Stannis will burn 
                   every Lannister he can find.  Of course 
                   I'm afraid. 
                    
                          SHAE 
                   I won't let them hurt you. 
                    
                          TYRION 
                   I'm a Lannister.  I don’t have a choice 
                   in all this.  But it's not your war. 
                    
           Shae climbs on top of Tyrion. 
                    
                          SHAE 
                   It is now. 
                    
                          TYRION 
                   You can't fuck your way out of 
                   everything.  
                    
                          SHAE 
                   I have so far.  Do you remember what you 
                   said when you met me in your tent?  That 
                   I should make love to you like it was 
                   your last day on this earth. 
                    
           Shae kisses Tyrion.

                   As you know, Your Grace, it is not only 
                   the sworn duty of a Maester to carry out 
                   the wishes of the house he serves, but 
                   also to offer guidance and console in 
                   times of war. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   Your words are always wise and measured.

                   If anything, a maester's duties become 
                   more urgent in times of war and in 
                   turmoil.  I remember back in the days of

                   Yes.  Eh, essence of nightshade is as 
                   dangerous as it is efficacious.  A 
                   single drop in a cup of wine is suffices 
                   to soothe ragged nerves.  Three drops 
                   will bring on a deep and dreamless 
                   sleep.  Ten drops, however... 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   I know what ten drops will bring. 
                    
                          PYCELLE 
                   You Grace, if I may ask... 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   You may not.  You must have a lot of 
                   work to do.  I'm sure many brave men 
                   will need your wisdom soon. 
                    
                          PYCELLE 
                   Yes.  Ah, a siege is very... 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester.  
                   There are so many. 
                    
                          PYCELLE 
                   Your Grace.

                          BRONN 
                   I know what in means.  Do you know how 
                   to use that? 
                    
                          TYRION 
                   I chopped wood once.  No, I watched my 
                   brother chopping wood. 
                    
                          BRONN 
                   I saw you kill a man with a shield.  
                   You'll be unstoppable with an axe.  (a 
                   beat) Don’t get killed. 
                    
                          TYRION 
                   Nor you, my friend.

                   Oh, are we friends now? 
                    
                          TYRION 
                   Of course we are.  Just because I pay 
                   you for your services doesn’t diminish 
                   our friendship.

                   Enhances it, really. 
                    
                          TYRION 
                   Oh, enhances.  Fancy word for a sell

           Bronn exits.  Sansa appears, waiting at the bottom of the 
           pillars with Shae.  Tyrion sidles over to them.

                   She has, My Lord, but King Joffrey sent 
                   for me to see him off. 
                    
           Joffrey enters the Throne Room, followed by The 
           Hound and gold cloaks.

                   Sansa, come here! 
                    
                          SANSA 
                   I will pray for your safe return, My

                          SANSA 
                   Just as I pray for the King's. 
                    
           Sansa turns away from Tyrion and walks over to Joffrey.  
           Tyrion stands with Shae.

           Joffrey draws his sword.

                   My new blade.  Heart-eater, I've named

           Sansa obeys.  She leans over and kisses the blade. 
                    
                          JOFFREY 
                   You'll kiss it again when I return, and 
                   taste my uncle's blood.

                   So you'll be outside the gates fighting 
                   in the vanguard? 
                    
                          JOFFREY 
                   A king doesn’t discuss battle plans with 
                   stupid girls.

                   I'm sorry, Your Grace.  You're right.  
                   I'm stupid.  Of course you'll be in the 
                   vanguard.  They say my brother Robb 
                   always goes where the fighting is the 
                   thickest.  And he's only a pretender.

                   Your brother's turn will come.  Then you 
                   can lick his blood off Heart-eater, too. 
                    
           Joffrey walks away from Sansa.  The Hound and guardsmen 
           follow, along with Lannister guards.  Sansa and Shae stand 
           alone.

                   The Hand of the King would like me to

                   Maybe she's jealous of you. 
                    
                          SANSA 
                   Why would she be jealous? 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   Sansa? 
                    
           Sansa walks over to Cersei. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   I was wondering where our little dove 
                   had flown.  You look pale, child.  Is 
                   your red flower still blooming? 
                    
      01:21:15 
                          SANSA 
                   Yes. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   Fitting, isn’t it?  The men will bleed 
                   out there and you will bleed in here. 
                    
                          CERSEI (to serving girl) 
                   Pour Lady Sansa some wine. 
                    
                          SANSA 
                   I'm not thirsty, Your Grace. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   So?  I didn’t offer you water. 
                    
           Cersei hands Sansa a cup of wine and notices Ser 
           Ilyn Payne standing in the back of the room. 
            
                          SANSA 
                   What's he doing here? 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   Ser Ilyn?  He's here to defend us.  When 
                   the axes smash down those doors, you may 
                   be glad to have him. 
                    
                          SANSA 
                   But we have guards to defend us. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   Guards we have paid.  Should the city 
                   fall, they'll be the first ones out of

                          KINGSGUARD 
                   The lads caught a groom and two maids 
                   trying to sneak away with a stolen horse 
                   and some gold cups. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   The battle's first traitors.  Have Ser 
                   Ilyn see to them.  Put their heads on 
                   spikes outside the stables as a warning. 
                    
           The Kingsguard bows and exits.

                          CERSEI 
                   The only way to keep the small folk 
                   loyal is to make certain they fear you 
                   more than they do the enemy.  Remember 
                   that if you ever hope to become a queen. 
                    
                          SANSA 
                   You said he was here to protect us. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   He is.  Traitors are a danger to us all.  
                   More wine. 
                    
           Cersei holds up her cup to the serving girl.

           Tyrion throws fire out into the distance, over the wall.  
           From the riverbank below, Bronn dips his arrow into the

                   Oh, shut up, little fool.  Praying to 
                   the Gods to have mercy on us all.  The 
                   Gods have no mercy.  That's why they're 
                   Gods.  My father told me that when he 
                   caught me praying.  My mother had just 
                   died, you see.  I didn’t really 
                   understand the concept of death and the 
                   finality of it.  I thought that if I 
                   prayed very, very hard, the Gods would 
                   return my mother to me.  I was four.

                   I should have been born a man.  I'd 
                   rather face a thousand swords than be 
                   shut up inside with this flock of 
                   frightened hens. 
                    
                          SANSA 
                   They're your guests under your 
                   protection.  You asked them here. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   It was expected of me, as it will be of 
                   you if you ever become Joffrey's Queen.  
                   If my retched brother should somehow 
                   prevail, these hens will return to their 
                   cocks and crow of how my courage 
                   inspired them.  Lifted their spirits. 
                    
                          SANSA 
                   And if the city should fall? 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   You'd like that, wouldn’t you?  The Red 
                   Keep should hold for a time, long enough 
                   for me to go to the walls and yield to 
                   Lord Stannis in person.  If it were 
                   anyone else outside those gates, I might 
                   have hoped for a private audience, but 
                   this is Stannis Baratheon.  I'd have a 
                   better chance of seducing his whores.  
                   Have I shocked you, little dove?  Tears

                   understand why they treated us 
                   differently.  Jamie was taught to fight 
                   with sword and lance and mace and I was 
                   taught to smile and sing and please.  He 
                   was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was 
                   sold to some stranger like a horse to be 
                   ridden whenever he desired. 
                    
                          SANSA 
                   You were Robert's Queen. 
                    
                          TYRION 
                   And you will be Joffrey's.  Enjoy.  (a 
                   beat)  I don’t think I know this one. 
                    
           Cersei notices Shae and steps down.  She walks over to her. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   Pretty. 
                    
           Shae curtsies. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                           
                   That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen.  
                   Here, it's not difficult.  I mastered it 
                   when I was four.  Straighten your back, 
                   and then bend. 
                    
           Cersei demonstrates a curtsy, then Shae duplicates it. 
                    
                          CERSEI 
                   Better.  You learn fast.  How long have 
                   you been in Lady Sansa's service?

                   And when did you leave Lorath?  I had a 
                   Lorathi handmaiden once. 
                    
           Shae smiles. 
                    
                          SHAE 
                   But she was a nobleman's daughter.

           walking forward and screaming in agony.  He falls to the 
           ground and dies in front of Hound as Hound looks on.  A 
           Stannis guard approaches Hound.  Hound quickly draws his

           Tyrion realizes that Hound is afraid.  Hound 
           continues to drink wine.

           Hound walks away.  Joffrey is speechless.  In the distance, 
           skiffs continue to row on shore as guards jump out and join 
           the fight.  Archers at the top of the wall continue to shoot 
           their arrows.

           Stannis's men rush toward the wall and erect another ladder 
           as others use a skiff as a shield approaching the wall.  
           Fighting continues.  One of Stannis's men is shot down from 
           the ladder and falls below.  Stannis's men work together to 
           break down the gates, pushing forward a large column.

           guards fighting off Stannis's men.  Tyrion looks around and 
           the chaos.  The King's men notice that Joffrey has abandoned

           hand on his wounded chest.  He falls to the floor screaming 
           in pain.  Cersie walks away with Tommen as Lancel writhes on 
           the floor in agony.  Sansa addresses the women and children 
           in the holdfast.

                   He's fighting bravely.  His knights have 
                   rallied behind him.  They will save the

           Sansa runs down the hall toward her chamber and bars the 
           door shut.  She leans against it for a moment, then grabs a 
           lantern and looks at a doll that her father had given her.  
           She hears a male voice in the darkness and turns around,

                   Look at me!  Stannis is a killer.  The

                   was a killer.  Your brother is a killer.

           Men tip over one of the skiffs.  Tyrion looks on as fire is 
           thrown from the top and sets the skiff ablaze.  Lannister 
           men cheer and Tyrion removes his helmet.

           Tyrion looks out into the distance where a huge team of 
           Baratheon men rush toward the city walls.  The Baratheon 
           troops hit them like a tidal wave.

           EXT. KING'S LANDING GATE - NIGHT 
            
           A Baratheon man is bashing at Tyrion's shield, until one of 
           Tyrion's men comes to the rescue and kills his would-be 
           killer.  Tyrion smiles.  A flying battle axe splits the 
           man's forehead and the rescuer falls dead.  Tyion spots Ser 
           Moore and smiles, but his expression changes when he Moore 
           raises his sword.  Tyrion staggers away, but the tip 
           connects and opens a deep gash on Tyrion's face.  Before 
           Moore can finish off Tyrion, Pod's spear enters Moore's 
           chest and he collapses.  Tyrion leans against Pod.
