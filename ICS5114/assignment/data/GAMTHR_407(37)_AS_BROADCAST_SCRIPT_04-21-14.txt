                     JAIME 
                I made a deal for you to keep  
                your ungrateful head 
                        
                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
                on your ungrateful neck  
                a little while longer. 
                        
        01:01:57:11  
                    TYRION (OS) 
                I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                The opportunity to live and die  
                at the Wall  
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                as punishment for a crime  
                I did not commit?   
         
        01:02:03:06  
                     JAIME 
                You threw your life away.  
                You threw it away. 
         
                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
                It's not a joke.  
                You understand that, don't you? 
         
        01:02:07:28  
                    TYRION (OS) 
                Of course it's a joke,  
                just not a very funny one.

                     I couldn't-- 
         
        01:02:15:16  
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  I couldn't listen to her 
         
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 standing there telling her lies. 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    I couldn't do it.

                     JAIME 
                 You fell in love with a whore. 
         
        01:02:23:29  
                    TYRION (OS) 
                Yes, I fell in love with a whore. 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                And I was stupid enough to think that she  
                had fallen in love with me. 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   That deal you made, 
         
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                it was everything Father wanted. 
         
                 TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                   You do see that?   
         
                 TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                 He gets you back as his heir.

                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
               And he ships me off to Castle Black, 
         
                       3 
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   out of sight at last. 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    All so perfect. 
         
        01:02:54:13  
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                It felt good to take that from him. 
         
        01:02:58:18  
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                He knows I'm innocent  
                and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. 
                        
                     JAIME 
                He's willing to sacrifice any of us. 
                        
                    TYRION (OS) 
                     Not you. 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  You're the golden son. 
                        
        01:03:08:09 
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 You could kill a king,  
                 lose a hand, 
         
                 TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                 fuck your own sister, 
                 you'll always be the golden son. 
         
                     JAIME 
                     Careful. 
         
        01:03:16:19  
                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
                 I'm the last friend you've got. 
                        
                     TYRION 
                 At least I got to tell them  
                 what they really are. 
         
                     JAIME 
                   Yes, brilliant speech. 
                       4 
                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
                 They'll be talking about it for days  
                 to come.   
                        
                  JAIME (CONT’D - OS) 
                 I thought you were a realist.   
                        
                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
                Didn't realize you'd die for pride. 
         
        01:03:33:14  
                     TYRION 
                 Don't give up on me just yet.  
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 I survived one trial by combat,   
                        
        01:03:38:23  
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                even though you weren't there  
                to save me. 
         
        01:03:40:29 
                     JAIME 
                I can't save you this time either. 
                        
                  JAIME (CONT’D - OS) 
                  My training has proved   
                        
                  JAIME (CONT’D - OS) 
             that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand. 
                        
        01:03:49:29  
         
             Tyrion goes to sit next to Jaime.

                Where's your sense of adventure?  
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 Even if you lose, imagine the look   
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 on Father's face when you fall.

                 Our family name snuffed out   
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                with a single swing of the sword. 
         
        01:04:02:23  
                     JAIME 
                    It is tempting. 
        01:04:04:14  
             (laughs)  
              
        01:04:20:17  
                     TYRION 
                      Well... 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 Bronn fought for me once,  
                 he'll do it again.   
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     If he wins,   
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  I expect I'll be in his debt   
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  for the rest of my life.   
                        
        01:04:32:15 
                     JAIME 
                     If he wins. 
         
                     TYRION 
                  Will you find him for me? 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 Who does Cersei plan on naming  
                 as a champion? 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.   
                        
                       6 
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel 
                that pompous child beater.   
                        
        01:04:47:26  
                     JAIME 
                      No. 
         
                   JAIME (CONT’D) 
                    Not Ser Meryn.

             Ser Gregor runs a spike through another man.

             Cersei is watching Guards order slaves to fight Ser Gregor 
             and he kills another. 
         
                     GUARD 
                    Go on, move it.

                     And you. 
                        
                   GUARD (CONT’D) 
                     Come on.

             The Mountain approaches the slaves. They fall to their knees, 
             begging. 
              
                    PRISONER 
                     Mercy.

                   CERSEI (CONT’D) 
               Thank you for riding here so quickly.

             Arya and Hound right up on a settlement. 
              
                     HOUND 
                    Could be food. 
         
        01:06:16:28 
                     ARYA 
                   Could be soldiers.

             Arya and Hound walk through the settlement and find a 
             wounded man in a ruined scene. 
           
                     ARYA 
              You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.  
                        
        01:06:46:00  
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                   Where else to sit? 
                        
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                 Tried to walk back to my hut,   
                        
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                    hurt too much.   
                        
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                 Then I remembered  
                 hey burned my hut down.   
         
        01:06:57:06 
                     HOUND 
                   Who were "they"? 
                        
                     CLAMM  
                 I stopped asking a while ago. 
                        
             Hound kneels to inspect Clamm’s wound. 
                        
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                 That's not gonna get better. 
                        
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                   Doesn't seem so. 
         
        01:07:09:29 
                     HOUND 
                   A bad way to go. 
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                  Haven't you had enough?   
                       9 
        01:07:15:18  
                     CLAMM 
                     Of what? 
                        
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                     I know. 
                        
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                     Time to go.   
                        
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                Take matters into my own hands.

                 CLAMM (CONT’D - OS) 
                The thought has occurred to me. 
              
             Arya kneels at Clamm’s side. 
         
                     ARYA 
                    So why go on? 
                        
                     CLAMM 
                      Habit. 
                        
                     ARYA 
                Nothing could be worse than this. 
         
                     CLAMM 
                Maybe nothing is worse than this. 
         
                     ARYA 
              Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. 
                        
                   ARYA (CONT’D) 
                  Nothing is just nothing.

                     CLAMM 
                    Who are you? 
         
                     ARYA 
                   My name is Arya.

        01:08:10:08  
                   ARYA (CONT’D) 
                     Arya Stark. 
         
                     CLAMM 
                    You her father? 
         
        01:08:17:25  
                     HOUND 
                     Her captor.  
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.   
                        
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                  A fair exchange, that is. 
                        
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                Always held to the notion of fair exchange   
                in all my dealings.  
                        
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                  You give me, I give you. 
         
        01:08:39:15  
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                      Fair. 
         
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                     A balance.   
                        
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                   No balance anymore.

                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                  Could I have a drink? 
         
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                  Dying is thirsty work. 
         
             Hound gives Clamm a drink. 
         
                   CLAMM (CONT’D) 
                   Wish it were wine. 
                      11 
                     HOUND 
                     So do I. 
                        
             Hound runs a dagger through Clamm and kills him. 
             He nods at Clamm as he is killing him.

        01:09:32:01 
         
             Hound removes his dagger and wipes off his dagger on the 
             man’s clothes. 
         
                     HOUND 
                  That's where the heart is. 
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                 That's how you kill a man. 
         
             A man attacks Hound from behind. 
         
        01:09:39:17

        01:09:41:22 
         
             Hound grabs his attacker and snaps his neck.

             There’s another man standing behind Hound. Hound turns to 
             him and wipes off his neck. 
              
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                   The fuck you doing?

                 when you tell him to fuck off. 
                        
                     RORGE 
                    The king's dead. 
                        
                  RORGE (CONT’D - OS) 
                 He drank poisoned wine  
                 at his own wedding. 
                        
                  RORGE (CONT’D - OS) 
                 The bounty on you is for killing  
                 Lannister soldiers. 
                        
                   RORGE (CONT’D)

                     HOUND 
                 And you thought you were going to  
                 collect it? 
         
                  HOUND (CONT’D - OS) 
                Didn't think very hard, did you? 
         
                     ARYA   
                 You were Yoren's prisoners when  
                 he was taking me to the Wall.

                     ARYA 
                 He told me he'd fuck me bloody  
                 with a stick. 
         
                    HOUND (OS) 
                 This day's really not working out  
                 the way you planned. 
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                   He on your little list?   
         
                     ARYA 
                    He can’t be.

                   ARYA (CONT’D) 
                  I don't know his name. 
         
        01:10:28:19  
                     HOUND 
                   What's your name?

                     ARYA 
                     Thank you. 
                        
             Arya draws her sword and stabs Rorge in the heart, 
              killing him.

                    You're learning. 
         
             Arya wipes her blade on Rorge’s clothing. Hound and Arya 
             walk away from the settlement.

                 in tonight's stew.

             Jon walks away and calls to his wolf to follow. 
         
                      JON 
                   Come on, Ghost.

             Jon is addressing the Night’s Watch. 
                        
                    JON (CONT’D) 
                Mance's army was closing in on  
                Craster's Keep when we left. 
                        
                    JON (CONT’D) 
                We saw their campfires  
                from Osric’s Hill. 
                        
                    JON (CONT’D) 
                They’ll reach the Wall before  
                the next full moon.

                     SLYNT 
                I'm surprised you didn't ride over  
                and say hello. 
         
                   SLYNT (CONT’D) 
                The King-beyond-the-Wall

                      JON 
                   We need to prepare. 
                        
                     ALLISER 
                  We've been preparing. 
                        
                      JON 
                 We should seal the tunnel.

                      JON 
                  Plug it with rocks and ice. 
         
                    JON (CONT’D) 
                  Flood it and let it freeze.

                    ALLISER (OS) 
                And how would we range north? 
                        
        01:12:05:08  
                      JON 
                    We wouldn’t.

                     ALLISER 
                 You would cut off our legs, 
         
                  ALLISER (CONT’D) 
                   pluck out our eyes, 
                        
                  ALLISER (CONT’D) 
                leave us cowering behind the Wall   
                        
                 ALLISER (CONT’D - OS) 
                 hoping for the storm to pass?

                 We can't defend the gate  
                 against 100,000 men. 
                        
                     ALLISER 
                 This castle has stood for  
                 thousands of years.  
                        
                     ALLISER 
                The Night's Watch has defended her  
                for thousands of years.   
                        
                     ALLISER 
                 And in all those centuries,  
                 we have never sealed the tunnel. 
                        
        01:12:26:06  
                      JON 
                 Have you ever seen a giant,  
                 Ser Alliser? 
         
                      17 
                  JON (CONT’D - OS) 
                     I have. 
         
        01:12:30:19  
                    JON (CONT’D) 
                The tunnel's gate won't stop them. 
         
                     ALLISER 
                 The bars on those gates are

                      JON 
                  They won't stop them. 
         
                     ALLISER 
                Remind me which order you belong to,  
                Lord Snow. 
         
                      JON 
                    The stewards. 
                        
                     ALLISER 
                Are the stewards responsible for maintaining  
                the tunnel? 
         
                      JON 
                      No. 
           
                     ALLISER 
                   Who would that be? 
         
        01:12:53:19  
                      JON 
                    The builders.

                   Ah, the builders.

                  ALLISER (CONT’D) 
                Lord Snow here recommends  
                sealing the tunnel, 
                        
                  ALLISER (CONT’D) 
                leaving us unable to carry out

                    ALLISER (OS) 
                Given your deep knowledge of

                 ALLISER (CONT’D - OS) 
                you and Tarly will take night duties

                 ALLISER (CONT’D - OS) 
                First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels of pitch

                   Lollys Stokeworth? 
                        
                 TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                 She doesn't strike me as

                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 did she mention that Lollys

                 Aye, I did know about

                     BRONN 
                  Falyse is 40 and barren.

                     TYRION 
                 She still gets Castle Stokeworth

                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                 Then Lollys gets the castle.

                 it'd better be a damn big castle. 
         
        01:15:36:24  
                     TYRION 
                I'm a bit short on castles  
                at the moment. 
         
        01:15:39:03  
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 But I can offer you  
                 gold and gratitude.   
         
                     BRONN 
                    I have gold. 
                        
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                 What can I buy with gratitude? 
         
                     TYRION 
                  You might be surprised. 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                A Lannister always pays his debts. 
         
        01:15:48:16  
                     BRONN 
                 Your sister's a Lannister, too.

                     TYRION 
                 My wife is heir to Winterfell. 
         
                 TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                If I emerge from this with my head  
                still on my shoulders, 
         
                 TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                I may one day rule the North  
                in her name. 
                        
                      23 
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 I could carve you out  
                 a big piece of it. 
         
        01:16:02:27  
                     BRONN 
                  If and may and could. 
         
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                  It's bloody cold up north.   
                        
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                  Lollys is soft and warm.   
                        
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                     And close.   
                        
                  BRONN (CONT’D - OS) 
                If I gave you the choice between  
                fucking Lollys 
         
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                and fighting the Mountain,  
                you'd have your britches down 
                        
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                and your cock out before  
                I could blink.

                     TYRION 
                 Does he frighten you so much? 
         
                    BRONN (OS) 
                I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't  
                frighten me. 
                        
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                He's freakish big and  
                reakish strong. 
                        
        01:16:23:28 
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                And quicker than you'd expect  
                for a man of that size. 
                        
                      24 
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                  Maybe I could take him,   
                        
                  BRONN (CONT’D - OS) 
                 dance around until he's so tired 
                        
                  BRONN (CONT’D - OS) 
                 of hacking at me, 
                 he dropped his sword, 
         
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                 get him off his feet somehow. 
                        
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                   But one misstep...

                    ...and I'm dead.   
                        
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                   Why should I risk it?   
                        
                     TYRION 
                  Because you're my friend. 
                        
        01:16:44:29  
                     BRONN 
                   Aye, I'm your friend. 
                        
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                 And when have you ever  
                 risked your life for me? 
         
             Bronn stands. 
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                     I like you, 
         
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                pampered little shit that you are. 
                        
                   BRONN (CONT’D) 
                  I just like myself more.   
                        
                        
                      25 
        01:17:06:16  
                     TYRION 
                    I understand. 
                        
                     BRONN 
                  I'm sorry it has to be this way. 
                        
                     TYRION 
                   Why are you sorry? 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 Because you're an evil bastard   
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                with no conscience and no heart? 
                        
                 TYRION (CONT’D – OS)) 
                 That's what I liked about you 
                 in the first place.   
                        
             Tyrion reaches out to shake Bronn’s hand. 
                        
        01:17:24:20  
                     BRONN 
                We had some good days together. 
                        
                     TYRION 
                    Yes, we did.

                   What will you do? 
                        
                     TYRION 
                I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain  
                myself. 
         
                     TYRION 
                Won't that make for a great song? 
                        
                     BRONN 
                I hope to hear them sing it one day.

             INT. DAENERYS’ BED CHAMBER – NIGHT. 
         
             Daenerys walks into her room. Daario is standing there. 
         
                    DAENERYS 
                  How did you get in here? 
                        
                     DAARIO 
                 Your door is well guarded, 
         
                   DAARIO (CONT’D) 
                  but your window is not. 
         
         
             Daenerys approaches Daario.  Daario gives her flowers. 
         
                   DAARIO (CONT’D) 
                I swam to an island a mile offshore  
                for these. 
         
        01:18:31:06  
                    DAENERYS 
                   Don't do that again. 
                        
             Danerys gives the flowers back. 
                        
                     DAARIO 
                 Never met a woman who  
                 didn't like wildflowers. 
                        
                    DAENERYS 
                 These are my private quarters. 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                 If I want you here,  
                 I will summon you. 
         
                      27 
        01:18:44:05 
         
             Daario kneels.  
         
                     DAARIO 
                 Forgive me, my queen.  
                 I live to serve you. 
                        
             Daenerys sits down. 
              
                   DAENERYS (OS) 
                  Tell me why you're here. 
         
             Daario rises to his feet. 
         
                     DAARIO 
                  I came to ask a favor. 
                        
                   DAARIO (CONT’D) 
               I only have two talents in this world-- 
                        
                   DAARIO (CONT’D) 
                   war and women. 
                        
                 DAARIO (CONT’D - OS) 
               You are staying here in Meereen to rule. 
         
        01:19:08:29 
                 DAARIO (CONT’D - OS) 
                That is a wise decision. I respect it. 
         
                   DAARIO (CONT’D) 
                 But here in Meereen,  
                 I cannot pursue my talents. 
                        
                    DAENERYS 
                 I've ordered the Second Sons  
                 to patrol the streets 
                        
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                 to stop the revenge killing.   
                        
        01:19:17:09  
                     DAARIO 
                 You've ordered us to be  
                 night watchmen. 
                      28 
                    DAENERYS 
                   And as for women, 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                 there are thousands in Meereen  
                 you can pursue. 
                        
                     DAARIO 
                   There is only one, 
                        
                   DAARIO (CONT’D) 
                 and she does not want me. 
                        
        01:19:31:10  
                    DAENERYS 
                 You swore me your sword. 
         
                     DAARIO 
                My sword is yours till the day I die. 
                        
                    DAENERYS 
                 So if I command you to stay  
                 in Meereen 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                  and patrol the streets? 
         
                     DAARIO 
                 I'll stay in Meereen and patrol  
                 the streets. 
         
                 DAARIO (CONT’D - OS) 
                 Send me to kill your enemies. 
         
        01:19:44:06  
                   DAARIO (CONT’D) 
                  Any enemy anywhere. 
                        
                   DAARIO (CONT’D) 
                  Let me do what I do best. 
                        
        01:19:51:13 
                    DAENERYS 
                     Very well. 
                        
                        
                      29 
             Daenerys rises and walks toward Daario. Pours a glass of 
             wine. 
                        
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                   Do what you do best.   
                        
        Returns to her seat. 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                  Take off your clothes.   
                        
        Daario sets the flowers on the table and takes off his clothes as Danerys 
        watches.

                      Oh. 
                        
                    MELISANDRE 
                 Come in, my queen. Please. 
                        
                     SELYSE 
                 I didn't mean to disturb you,  
                 my lady. 
         
                    MELISANDRE 
                 You could never disturb me. 
         
                     SELYSE 
                I just wanted to speak with you  
                before we left. 
                        
                    MELISANDRE 
                Could you bring me that vial  
                over there? 
         
             Selyse walks over to a shelf. 
         
         
                      30 
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                    The blue one.   
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                  No, no, no. Not that one. 
                        
        01:21:06:09 
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                You don't even want to touch  
                that one.   
         
                MELISANDRE (CONT’D - OS) 
                     Next to it. 
                        
                MELISANDRE (CONT’D - OS) 
                    That's the one.   
                        
             Selyse picks up the vial and brings it to Melisandre. 
                        
        01:21:22:10  
         
             Melisandre shakes the vial into the water. 
         
             (inhales) 
             Selyse is looking at the fire. 
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                When I looked into the flames  
                this morning, 
                        
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                  the Lord spoke to me. 
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                     He said, 
                        
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                "Tonight, you will have your last good bath  
                in a long while.   
                        
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                    Make it count."   
                        
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                     A joke.   
                        
                      31 
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                Not a very good one, I'm afraid. 
         
        01:21:52:19  
                    SELYSE (OS) 
                     It was. I-- 
                        
                   SELYSE (CONT’D) 
                  humor isn't my strength.   
                        
                    MELISANDRE 
                That's because most jokes are lies 
                        
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                 and you're devoted to the truth.   
                        
        01:22:01:23  
                     SELYSE 
                 If they're lies, my lady,  
                 aren't they best avoided? 
         
                    MELISANDRE 
                    Not always. 
                        
             Melisandre gets out of the bath and walks over to the shelf 
             and goes through the vials, picking them up and putting them 
             back. 
                        
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                Most of these powders and potions 
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                     are lies. 
                        
                MELISANDRE (CONT’D - OS) 
                Deceptions to make men think  
                they witnessed our Lord's power. 
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                Once they step into his light,  
                they will see the lie for what it was-- 
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                a trick that led them to the truth. 
         
         
                      32 
                MELISANDRE (CONT’D - OS) 
                A pinch of this powder in a bonfire 
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                will send a flaming column  
                screaming towards the sky. 
                        
                MELISANDRE (CONT’D - OS) 
                And this one creates a black smoke 
                        
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                that will make the bravest man  
                piss himself with fear. 
         
        01:22:43:14  
                MELISANDRE (CONT’D - OS) 
               And a drop of this in any man's wine 
         
        01:22:46:28  
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                 will drive him wild with lust. 
                        
                     SELYSE 
                 Did you use it with Stannis? 
         
        01:22:54:19  
                    MELISANDRE 
                      No. 
                        
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                    Don't be upset. 
                        
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                Men never crave what they  
                already have. 
         
        01:23:05:13  
         
             Melisandre reaches out and touches Selyse’s face. 
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                    It's only flesh. 
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                  It needs what it needs. 
         
                      33 
        01:23:13:09 
         
             Melisandre walks away and goes to put on her robe. 
           
                     SELYSE 
                No act done in service of the Lord 
         
                   SELYSE (CONT’D) 
                  can ever be called a sin. 
                        
                   SELYSE (CONT’D) 
                 I thank God every day for  
                 bringing you to us.   
                        
                   SELYSE (CONT’D) 
                   And Stannis to you. 
         
                   SELYSE (CONT’D) 
                He wants to bring Shireen with us. 
                        
                   SELYSE (CONT’D) 
                I think that would be ill-advised.   
                        
                  SELYSE (CONT’D - OS) 
                My daughter has heretical tendencies,  
                as you're well aware. 
                        
                   SELYSE (CONT’D) 
                I don't know if her doubt is real  
                or simply meant to spite me, 
         
                   SELYSE (CONT’D) 
                but whichever the case,  
                she should stay home. 
         
        01:23:49:12  
         
             Melisandre approaches Selyse and takes her hands. 
         
                    MELISANDRE 
                 I understand how you feel. 
         
                     SELYSE 
                      Hmm. 
         
         
                      34 
                    MELISANDRE 
                  But that is impossible. 
                        
                     SELYSE 
                      Why? 
                        
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                You don't need powders and potions,  
                my queen. 
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                   You don't need lies. 
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                You are strong enough to look  
                into the Lord's light 
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                 and see his truth for yourself. 
         
             Melisandre and Selyse look at the fire together. 
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                   However harsh it is. 
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                However hard for us to understand. 
         
        01:24:23:25  
                MELISANDRE (CONT’D - OS) 
                  You don't need my help, 
         
                MELISANDRE (CONT’D - OS) 
                 but I will need yours soon. 
                        
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                 When we set sail, your daughter  
                 must be with us. 
         
                 MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                   The Lord needs her. 
        01:24:44:07  
             INT. MEEREN HALLWAY – DAY 
              
             Daario sees Jorah on his way out of Daenerys’ chambers. 
         
                      35 
                     DAARIO 
                    Jorah the Andal. 
         
        01:24:47:25  
                   DAARIO (CONT’D) 
                 Are you here to see our queen?   
                        
                   DAARIO (CONT’D) 
                  She's in a good mood.   
                        
             Daario pats Jorah on the back and exits.  Jorah goes into 
             Daenerys’ chamber. 
                        
                     JORAH 
                     Khaleesi. 
           
        01:25:10:25 
                    DAENERYS 
                   You're here early. 
                        
                     JORAH 
                   Later than some. 
                        
                    DAENERYS 
                   You don't approve? 
                        
        01:25:17:05  
                    JORAH (OS) 
                 It's not a question of approval,  
                 it's a question of trust. 
         
                    DAENERYS 
                 You neither approve nor trust. 
                        
                     JORAH 
                 Why would I?  
                 The man's a sellsword. 
                        
                    DAENERYS 
                 Didn't you fight for  
                 the Golden Company 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                 before pledging your sword  
                 to my brother? 
         
                      36 
                     JORAH 
                      I did. 
                        
        01:25:28:09  
                    DAENERYS 
                     I trust you. 
         
        01:25:29:25 
                     JORAH 
                Daario Naharis killed his captains 
         
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                and dumped their heads at your feet  
                when he grew tired of their commands. 
         
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                How could you ever have faith 
                in a man like that? 
         
                    DAENERYS 
                I could never have faith in a man  
                like Daario. 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons 
                 to retake Yunkai. 
         
                     JORAH 
                     You have? 
                        
                    DAENERYS 
                     I have. 
         
        01:25:49:26  
                    JORAH (OS) 
                Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, 
         
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                I fear the masters will simply  
                bide their time, 
                        
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                wait for the invaders to leave  
                and reassert control. 
                        
                        
                      37 
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                That is why I've ordered Daario to execute  
                every master in Yunkai. 
         
                 DAENERYS (CONT’D - OS) 
                The masters tear babies  
                from their mothers' arms. 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
              They mutilate little boys by the thousands. 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                They train little girls in the art of pleasuring  
                old men. 
         
        01:26:09:21 
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                They treat men like beasts,  
                as you said yourself. 
         
                     JORAH 
                Herding the masters into pens and  
                slaughtering them by the thousands 
         
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                 is also treating men like beasts. 
         
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                   The slaves you freed, 
         
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                brutality is all they've ever known. 
                        
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                If you want them to know  
                something else, 
                        
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                 you'll have to show it to them. 
         
                    DAENERYS 
                And repay the slavers with what?  
                Kindness? 
                        
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                  A fine? A stern warning? 
                      38 
                    JORAH (OS) 
                It's tempting to see your enemies as evil,  
                all of them, 
                        
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                but there's good and evil on both sides  
                in every war ever fought. 
                        
                   DAENERYS (OS) 
                 Let the priests argue  
                 over good and evil. 
         
        01:26:38:03 
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                    Slavery is real. 
                        
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                  I can end it. I will end it. 
         
        01:26:42:03  
                 DAENERYS (CONT’D - OS) 
                 And I will end those behind it. 
         
             Jorah approaches Daenerys. 
         
                     JORAH 
                I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi. 
         
        01:26:46:24 
         
             Daenerys goes to Jorah and takes his hands. 
         
                    DAENERYS 
                And now you are helping me  
                show them to freedom. 
                        
                     JORAH 
                I wouldn't be here to help you 
                 if Ned Stark had done to me 
                        
                   JORAH (CONT’D) 
                what you want to do 
                 to the masters of Yunkai. 
         
         
         
                      39 
                    DAENERYS 
                The man who came to me the other day  
                about burying his father. 
         
                     JORAH 
                   Hizdahr zo Loraq? 
         
                    DAENERYS 
               He will accompany the Second Sons 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                and serve as my ambassador  
                to Yunkai. 
                        
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                He will tell the masters  
                what has happened in Meereen. 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                He will explain the choice  
                they have before them. 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                 They can live in my new world 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                 or they can die in their old one. 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                Well, go and catch Daario 
                 before he leaves. 
         
             Jorah nods. 
         
        01:27:30:14  
         
             Jorah exits. 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                 Tell him I changed my mind. 
                        
                     JORAH 
                    Yes, Khaleesi. 
                        
                    DAENERYS 
                      No. 
                      40 
         
             Jorah turns back to Daenerys. 
         
                  DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                Tell him you changed my mind. 
         
             Jorah exits. 
         
        01:27:58:00 
                           EXT. CAMP – DAY 
         
             (Hound grunts) 
         
                     HOUND 
                     Rat cunts. 
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                    Fucking whore.   
                        
             Hound is trying to doctor  his neck as Arya cleans her blade. 
         
                     ARYA 
                  You're doing it wrong. 
         
        01:28:08:08  
                   ARYA (CONT’D) 
                You need to burn away  
                that horrible bit there. 
                        
                   ARYA (CONT’D) 
                Otherwise it's gonna get infected  
                and fester. 
                        
                   ARYA (CONT’D) 
                I know you don't like fire,  
                but if you don't do it right-- 
                        
             Arya puts down her sword. 
                        
                     HOUND 
                     No fire. 
                        
                     ARYA 
                  It’ll only take a second. 
         
             Arya goes to get a burning stick from the fire. 
                      41 
        01:28:24:21  
                   ARYA (CONT’D) 
                  It won’t hurt that much. 
                        
             Hound jumps back. 
                        
                     HOUND 
                     No fire! 
                        
             Arya goes back to her blade cleaning. 
         
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                    Shut up about it. 
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                  Shut up about everything. 
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                Thanks to you,  
                I'm a walking bag of silver 
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. 
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                Which is everywhere between  
                where we are now 
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                  and where we're going. 
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                I'm as stupid as that hog  
                you stuck back in the village, 
                        
             Hound sits. 
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                getting myself cut and stabbed  
                and bitten. 
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
               No reward is worth this much trouble. 
                        
                  HOUND (CONT’D - OS) 
                Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. 
                      42 
        01:29:27:01 
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                You say your brother gave you  
                that sword.   
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                  My brother gave me this.   
                        
             Hound points to the burned side of his face. 
                        
        01:29:32:12 
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
               It was just like you said a while back.  
                        
                  HOUND (CONT’D - OS) 
                  Pressed me to the fire  
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.   
                        
                     ARYA 
                      Why? 
                        
                     HOUND 
                 Thought I stole one of his toys. 
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
               I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it.   
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                   The pain was bad.   
                        
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                  The smell was worse.   
                        
        01:30:04:26  
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                But the worst thing was that it was  
                my brother who did it. 
         
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                My father, who protected him... 
         
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
               told everyone my bedding caught fire. 
         
                      43 
         
        Hound turns to look at Arya. 
         
                   HOUND (CONT’D) 
                 You think you're on your own? 
                        
                     ARYA 
                   Let me wash it out 
         
        01:30:40:16  
                   ARYA (CONT’D) 
                 and help you sew it up at least. 
                        
             Arya walks over to Hound and begins cleaning his wound. 
         
        01:31:09:12 
             INT. PUB – DAY. 
              
             A kidney pie is placed on a table where Podrick and Brienne 
             are sitting, drinking and eating. 
           
                     BRIENNE 
                Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. 
                        
                  BRIENNE (CONT’D) 
                We've been sleeping in ditches 
                the last few weeks. 
                        
                  BRIENNE (CONT’D) 
                I think we can treat ourselves  
                to a featherbed for the night 
                        
                  BRIENNE (CONT’D) 
                and a hot meal not cooked by you. 
         
        01:31:19:17  
                     PODRICK 
                 Couldn't agree more, my lady. 
                        
                     BRIENNE 
                Just don't start expecting 
                silk underclothes. 
                        
                  BRIENNE (CONT’D) 
                Not working for your former lord  
                any longer. 
                      44 
        01:31:25:13  
                     PODRICK 
                    Yes, my lady. 
         
             A waiter comes over to fill their drinks.  Podrick is chugging.  
             Brienner takes his cup from his mouth. 
         
                     BRIENNE 
                    Don't get drunk. 
                        
                     PODRICK 
                    No, my lady.

             Hot Pie pulls up a stool and sits down with Pod and Brienne. 
                        
                   HOT PIE (CONT’D) 
                A good kidney pie is  
                all about the ingredients. 
         
                 HOT PIE (CONT’D - OS) 
                 Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. 
                        
                   HOT PIE (CONT’D) 
                 Easy enough. But the meat, 
                        
                   HOT PIE (CONT’D) 
                peacetime or not, getting your hands

                   HOT PIE (CONT’D) 
                I mean, some people settle for  
                plain old beef kidneys. 
                        
                   HOT PIE (CONT’D) 
               Got no right to cook anything, them.

                Don't get me started on the gravy. 
                        
                 HOT PIE (CONT’D - OS) 
                  Very difficult to get right.

               See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. 
                        
                   HOT PIE (CONT’D) 
                You cannot give up on the gravy.

                are usually knights.

                  PODRICK (CONT’D) 
                  Catelyn Stark's sister.   
                        
                  PODRICK (CONT’D) 
                 She's Arya's last living relative  
                with money.   
                        
                  PODRICK (CONT’D) 
                  She hates the Lannisters.   
                        
                  PODRICK (CONT’D) 
                 Lord Tyrion made sure I knew 
                        
                      52 
                  PODRICK (CONT’D) 
                which house married which  
                and who hated who. 
         
        01:35:51:03   
                     BRIENNE 
                  Sansa could be there, too. 
         
                     PODRICK 
                      Aye, my lady. 
                        
                  PODRICK (CONT’D) 
                     Could be. 
         
             Brienne and Pod stop at a fork in the road. 
                        
                     BRIENNE 
                   You sure about this? 
                        
                     PODRICK 
                      No. 
                        
             Brienne and Pod continue on the road. 
         
        01:36:25:05 
             INT. CASTERLY ROCK DUNGEON – NIGHT 
         
             (door opens) 
              
             Oberyn enters Tyrion’s cell. 
              
                     TYRION 
                I imagined you'd be back at the brothel  
                at this hour. 
                        
                     OBERYN 
                I did spend some time with  
                an absolutely stunning blonde the other day. 
         
        01:36:49:02 
                     TYRION 
                    Mm, do tell. 
         
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
               I've got every kind of filth down here 
         
                      53 
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  except the kind I like. 
                        
        01:36:56:27   
                     OBERYN 
                    Your sister. 
                        
                     TYRION 
                      Oh. 
         
             Oberyn pulls up a seat and sits across from Tyrion. 
         
                     OBERYN 
                  Cersei approached me. 
                        
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                 We spoke a great deal  
                 about her daughter. 
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
               How worried your sister is about her. 
                        
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                She was trying very hard to pretend 
                        
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                she had not come to sway me  
                against you. 
                        
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                I think she may have even believed it  
                herself. 
         
         
        01:37:23:18  
                     TYRION 
                 Making honest feelings  
                 do dishonest work 
         
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  is one of her many gifts. 
                        
                     OBERYN 
                 It was difficult for her to hide  
                 her true intentions. 
         
                      54 
        01:37:33:11  
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 It is rare to meet a Lannister 
         
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 who shares my enthusiasm  
                 for dead Lannisters. 
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 She desperately wants to  
                 see you killed. 
         
        01:37:45:19  
                     TYRION 
                 She didn't need to bother you. 
         
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 It looks as though I've taken care  
                 of that myself. 
                        
                 TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                   The joy she will feel 
         
                 TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                when my head leaves my neck. 
                        
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                She's wanted this for a long time. 
                        
        01:38:00:04  
                     OBERYN 
                    Yes, I know. 
         
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                   We met, you and I. 
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                     Many years ago. 
                        
                     TYRION 
                   I think I would have  
                   remembered that. 
                        
                     OBERYN 
                Unlikely. You had just been born. 
         
                      55 
        01:38:16:15  
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 Our father brought me and  
                 my sister Elia with him 
           
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 on a visit to Casterly Rock. 
         
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                My first time away from Dorne. 
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
               I didn't like anything about the Rock. 
         
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 Not the food, not the weather, 
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                   not your accents.   
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                     Nothing. 
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                  But the biggest disappointment...   
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                      you.   
         
        01:38:40:08   
                     TYRION 
                 You and my family have more in common  
                 than you might admit. 
                        
                    OBERYN (OS) 
                 The whole way from Dorne 
                        
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
               all anyone talked about was the monster   
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
               that had been born to Tywin Lannister. 
         
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                A head twice the size of his body, 
                        
                      56 
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                  a tail between his legs,   
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                   claws, one red eye, 
         
        01:38:58:17  
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                the privates of both a girl and a boy. 
         
        01:39:01:18  
                     TYRION 
                That would have made things  
                so much easier. 
         
                    OBERYN (OS) 
                When we met your sister,  
                she promised she would show you to us. 
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                  Every day we would ask. 
         
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                Every day she would say, "Soon." 
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 Then she and your brother   
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 took us to your nursery and... 
         
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                  she unveiled the freak. 
         
        01:39:24:24  
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                  Your head was a bit large.   
                        
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
               Your arms and legs were a bit small, 
         
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                    but no claw. 
                        
                        
         
                      57 
        01:39:30:11  
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
               No red eye. No tail between your legs. 
         
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                   Just a tiny pink cock. 
                        
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                 We didn't try to hide  
                 our disappointment.   
         
        01:39:38:24    
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
               "That's not a monster," I told Cersei.   
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                   "That's just a baby."   
                        
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                 And she said, "He killed my mother." 
                        
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                And she pinched your little cock  
                so hard, 
         
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                 I thought she might pull it off. 
                        
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                Until your brother made her stop. 
         
        01:39:55:09 
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                 "It doesn't matter," she told us. 
         
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                "Everyone says he will die soon. 
                        
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                   I hope they are right. 
         
                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                He should not have lived this long." 
         
         
         
                      58 
        01:40:08:03  
                     TYRION 
                      Well... 
         
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 sooner or later,  
                 Cersei always gets what she wants.   
         
        01:40:19:06 
                     OBERYN 
                 And what about what I want? 
         
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                     Justice 
         
        01:40:26:21 
                     OBERYN 
                 for my sister and her children. 
         
                     TYRION 
                   If you want justice, 
         
                   TYRION (CONT’D) 
                you've come to the wrong place. 
         
        01:40:35:08  
                     OBERYN 
                     I disagree. 
              
             Oberyn stands up. 
         
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 I've come to the perfect place. 
         
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 I want to bring those who  
                 have wronged me to justice. 
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 And all those who have wronged me  
                 are right here. 
         
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 I will begin with  
                 Ser Gregor Clegane,

                 OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                 who killed my sister's children 
                        
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                 and then raped her with their blood  
                 still on his hands 
         
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                  before killing her, too. 
         
        01:41:17:10  
         
             Oberyn takes the torch in his hand. 
         
                  OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                  I will be your champion.

             EXT. THE EYRIE – DAY 
              
             Sansa is building a castle in the snow. Robin comes out. 
           
                     SANSA 
                    Hello, Robin. 
         
        01:42:18:06 
                     ROBIN 
                   What are you doing? 
         
                     SANSA  
                I'm building my home, Winterfell. 
         
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                   At least I think I am. 
                        
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                 I haven't been back there  
                 in a very long time. 
         
             Robin sits with Sansa. 
              
                     ROBIN 
                   Why did you leave? 
                      60 
        01:42:28:22  
                     SANSA  
                    It's a long story. 
                        
                     ROBIN 
                  I stay here in the Eyrie. 
         
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                Mother says it's dangerous on the roads  
                and I have to keep myself safe 
                        
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                because I'm the Lord of the Vale   
                        
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                 and the Lord of the Vale  
                 is a very important person. 
         
        01:42:41:04 
                     SANSA 
                  Yes, you certainly are. 
         
                     ROBIN 
                  When will you go back? 
                        
                     SANSA 
                    Probably never. 
         
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
               My family doesn't live there anymore 
         
        01:42:50:21  
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                 and someone burned it down. 
         
        01:42:54:08 
                     ROBIN 
                      Oh. 
                        
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                 Does Winterfell have a Moon Door? 
                        
                     SANSA 
                   No, I'm afraid not. 
         
         
                      61 
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                 It's not high up in the mountains.  
                 It's down on the ground. 
         
        01:43:02:27    
                     ROBIN 
                  That sounds dangerous 
                        
             (chuckles) 
              
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                 How do you make people fly? 
                        
                     SANSA 
                     We don’t. 
         
        01:43:07:18    
                     ROBIN 
               What do you do with all the bad people 
         
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                 and the scary people and  
                 the people you don't like? 
         
                     SANSA 
                 I never did anything with them at all. 
                        
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                 Girls didn't take part in that  
                 where I came from. 
         
        01:43:15:23  
                     ROBIN 
                 Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. 
         
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                 When I grow up, I'll be able to fly  
                 anybody who bothers me. 
                        
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                 Or you. When we get married, 
         
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                 you can tell me if you  
                 don't like somebody 
         
                      62 
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                 and then we can bring them  
                 back here and, whoosh! 
         
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                 Right through the Moon Door. 
         
        01:43:32:10  
                     SANSA 
                  I like the sound of that. 
         
                     ROBIN 
                 Let's put a Moon Door  
                 in your Winterfell. 
         
                     SANSA 
                     All right. 
         
                     ROBIN 
                It can go in here in this big tower. 
         
             Robin points to a tower and accidentally knocks it over. 
         
                     SANSA 
                  Careful. You've ruined it. 
         
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                 Now I'm going to have to rebuild  
                 the whole thing. 
         
        01:43:43:06 
         
             Robin and Sansa stand up. 
         
                     ROBIN 
                    I didn’t ruin it. 
                        
                     SANSA 
                     You did. 
                        
        01:43:44:25 
                     ROBIN 
                 It was already ruined because  
                 it didn't have a Moon Door. 
                        
                        
                      63 
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                    I was fixing it. 
                        
                     SANSA 
               Knocking things down isn't fixing them. 
                        
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                   It’s ruining them! 
                        
                     ROBIN 
                    I didn’t ruin it! 
                        
                     SANSA 
                   You’re being stupid 
                        
                     ROBIN 
                    I didn’t ruin it! 
                        
             Robin kicks down the rest of Sansa’s castle. 
                        
        01:43:53:22 
             (grunting) 
              
        01:43:59:12 
         
             Sansa slaps Robin. 
         
             (gasps) 
              
        01:44:04:04 
             (crying) 
              
             Robin runs off. 
              
                     SANSA 
                   Robin, I'm sorry, I-- 
                          
        01:44:07:23  
                   LITTLEFINGER 
                     Children. 
                        
             Littlefinger descends on the courtyard. 
                        
                     SANSA 
                     I hit him. 
                        
                      64 
                   LITTLEFINGER 
                     Yes, I saw. 
                        
                     SANSA 
                 I shouldn't have done that. 
                        
        01:44:16:28   
                     ROBIN 
                 No, his mother should have 
                        
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                    a long time ago.   
                        
                   ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                   Consider it a step in  
                   the right direction.   
                        
                     SANSA 
                  If he tells Aunt Lysa... 
                        
                   LITTLEFINGER 
                Let me worry about Aunt Lysa. 
                        
          01:44:32:22  
                     SANSA 
                 I was trying to remember what 
                  everything looked like. 
                        
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                   I'll never see it again.   
                        
                   LITTLEFINGER 
                 A lot can happen between  
                 now and never. 
                        
        01:44:45:21  
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                  If you want to build a better home,   
                        
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                first you must demolish the old one.   
                        
                     SANSA 
                Why did you really kill Joffrey? 
                        
                        
                      65 
                     SANSA 
                    Tell me why.   
                        
                   LITTLEFINGER  
                  I loved your mother more  
                 than you could ever know. 
                        
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    Given the opportunity,  
                  what do we do to those   
                        
          01:45:15:04 
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                 who've hurt the ones we love?   
                        
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   In a better world,   
                        
             Littlefinger gets close to Sansa’s face. 
                        
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                      one where love   
                        
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                could overcome strength and duty,  
                        
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                 you might have been my child.   
                        
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                 But we don't live in that world.   
                        
             Littlefinger puts his hands on Sansa’s cloak. 
         
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
               You're more beautiful than she ever was.   
                        
        01:45:58:13 
                     SANA 
                    Lord Baelish... 
         
                   LITTLEFINGER 
                    Call me Petyr. 
                        
             Littlefinger kisses Sansa. 
             Sansa pulls away. 
                      66 
        01:46:27:17 
             INT. THE EYRIE – DAY. 
         
             (wind whistling) 
              
                     SANSA 
                You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa? 
         
                      LYSA 
                   Come here, Sansa. 
                        
             Sansa goes to stand with Lysa by the moon door. 
                        
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                Do you know how far the fall is? 
         
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                  Neither do I, precisely.

                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                   Hundreds of feet.   
                        
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                    It's fascinating   
                        
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                what happens to bodies 
                when they hit the rocks from such a height. 
                        
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                The impact breaks them right apart. 
         
                  LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                Like eggs dropped on the floor. 
         
        01:47:10:28 
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                Sometimes pieces remain intact. 
                        
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
               You'll find the head sitting on its own. 
         
                  LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                   Every hair in place 
                        
                      67 
                  LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                 Blue eyes staring at nothing. 
         
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                   I know what you did. 
         
        01:47:34:28   
                     SANSA 
                  I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. 
         
                   SANSA (CONT’D) 
                 I never should have hit Robin, I know it.  
                 I promise it won't happen--   
                        
                      LYSA 
                 Don't be coy with me,  
                 you little whore. 
         
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 You kissed him.  
                 You kissed Petyr. 
         
        01:47:43:27 
                     SANSA 
                 I didn’t. You don’t understand. 
                        
                      LYSA 
                     I saw you. 
                        
             Lysa grabs Sansa. 
         
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 You can't lie to me 
                 because I saw it with my own eyes. 
         
                     SANSA 
                 He kissed me. I pulled away. 
                        
             Lysa grabs Sansa by the back of the head 
              and pushes her down by the edge of the moon door. 
                        
                      LYSA 
                      Liar!

                      LYSA 
                   Whore! He is mine! 
                        
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                My father, my husband, my sister, 
                        
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 they all stood between us  
                 and now they're all dead. 
                        
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 That's what happens to people who stand 
                 between Petyr and me. 
                        
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                    Look down! 
                        
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                    Look down! 
                    Look down! 
                    Look down!

             Lysa turns to see Littlefinger at the door. 
                        
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                     Let her go.   
         
        01:48:10:05  
                      LYSA 
                    You want her? 
                        
                   LYSA (CONT’D) 
                  This empty-headed child? 
                        
                   LITTLEFINGER 
                     Let her go. 
                        
                     LYSA (CONT’D) 
                 She's just like her mother.  
                 She'll never love you. 
                        
                        
                      69 
                     LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                    I lied for you. 
         
                     LYSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                    I killed for you. 
                        
                     LYSA (CONT’D) 
                Why did you bring her here? Why?   
                        
        01:48:32:25 
                   LITTLEFINGER 
                   I'll send her away. 
         
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   I swear on my life. 
                        
                  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                  I swear to all the gods. 
         
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    Let her go, Lysa

             Lysa throws Sansa on the ground away from the moon door. 
         
        01:49:02:25  
         
             Lysa is doubled over, crying. Littlefinger goes to her side. 
         
         
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   Oh, my sweet wife.   
                        
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   My sweet, silly wife.   
                        
             Littlefinger and Lysa stand together. 
                        
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                I have only loved one woman...

                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                     only one, 
                        
                 LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    Your sister.   
                        
             Littlefinger pushes Lysa down the moon door.
