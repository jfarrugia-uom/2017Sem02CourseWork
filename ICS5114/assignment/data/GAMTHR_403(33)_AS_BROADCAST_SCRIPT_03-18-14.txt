           Running, Dontos leads Sansa through alleyways of city.to the rocky 
           shore. Dontos climbs into a dinghy.

           Sansa looks back toward city. Frustrated, she climbs into the dinghy. 
         
           EXT. OCEAN – DAY 
         
           Dontos rows dinghy out to sea. They row through a dense fog. Sansa 
           sees something ahead and lowers her hood. A boat appears before 
           them. Dontos holds out his hand to help Sansa to board. 
         
        01:03:37:13  
                      DONTOS 
                   Up you go, my lady. You’ll be fine. You're 
                   stronger than you know. 
         
           Sansa climbs up ladder. As she reaches the top, Littlefinger grabs her 
           and pulls her onto the deck, happy to see her.

                   Good. Good. I'm sure you’ve had quite a fright. 
                   Rest easy. The worst is past. 
         
           Dontos calls up from the dinghy below. 
         
        01:04:14:15 
                      DONTOS 
                   Lord Baelish. I promised I’d get you to her safely. 
         
           Littlefinger leans down to hush Dontos. 
         
        01:04:16:18 
                    LITTLEFINGER 
                   Softly, my friend. Voices carry over water. 
         
        01:04:20:23 
                      DONTOS 
                   I should get back before someone thinks to look 
                   for me. 
         
        01:04:23:24  
                    LITTLEFINGER 
                   First you’ll want your pay. Ten thousand, was it? 
         
        01:04:27:21 
                      DONTOS 
                   (overlap) Ten thousand. 
                    
           Littlefinger snaps his fingers, and unseen man approaches with 
           crossbow. Sansa gasps. The crossbow fires..  
            
        01:04:34:13  
                      DONTOS 
                   Wait! (groans) 
         
           The arrow strikes Dontos in the chest. Sansa is horrified.

           Littlefinger pulls Sansa back from the sight. Dontos lies dead in his 
           dinghy. 
            
           Littlefinger holds Sansa and tries to quiet her.

                    LITTLEFINGER 
                   Shh. You don’t want the queen to hear, do 
                   you? One thousand gold cloaks are searching 
                   for you. And if they found you, how do you 
                   think they would punish the girl who murdered 
                   the king? 
         
        01:04:50:05  
                      SANSA 
                   I didn't murder anyone. 
         
           Sansa moves to railing and looks down at Dontos.

                    LITTLEFINGER 
                   I know. I know. But you must admit, it looks 
                   suspicious. The king who executed your father, 
                   who tormented you for years, and you fled the 
                   scene of his murder.

                   Why did you kill him?

                     LITTLEFINGER 
                   Because he was a drunk and a fool, and I don’t 
                   trust drunk fools.

                   Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. 
                   Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. 
                   Money buys a man’s silence for a time. A bolt in 
                   the heart buys it forever.

           Littlefinger removes the necklace from Sansa’s neck. 
         
        01:05:30:22  
                    LITTLEFINGER 
                   Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that 
                   once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy 
                   of House Hollard.  
         
           Littlefinger places the necklace on surface and smashes it with his 
           knife. It crushes, glass. Sansa is shocked.

                   I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once 
                   tell you about the capital?

                   We’re all liars here. 
         
           Littlefinger sweeps the glass over side of boat. It lands on Dontos’ 
           body in the dinghy. Littlefinger puts his arm around Sansa and leads 
           her off.

                   courtesy of consummating the marriage before

                   means?  
         
           Tywin approaches them. 
         
        01:08:13:11 
                      TYWIN 
                   I'm not trying to trick you. 
         
        01:08:17:25  
                      TOMMEN 
                   It means I’ll become king. 
         
        01:08:19:10  
                      TYWIN 
                   Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do 
                   you think you’ll be?

                      TOMMEN 
                   A good king? 
         
           Tommen looks to Tywin. Tywin nods slightly. 
         
        01:08:27:25  
                      TYWIN 
                   Mm. I think so as well. You’ve got the 
                   temperament for it. But what makes a good king? 
                   Hmm? What is a good king’s single most 
                   important quality? 
         
        01:08:42:03  
                      CERSEI 
                   This is hardly the place or the time. 
         
        01:08:45:12 
                      TOMMEN 
                   Holiness? 
               
           Tywin nods, considering. 
         
        01:08:47:00  
                      TYWIN 
                   Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He 
                   built this sept. He also named a six year-old boy 
                   high septon because he thought the boy could work 
                   miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early 
                   grave because food was of this world, and this 
                   world was sinful. 
         
        01:09:14:23  
                      TOMMEN 
                   Justice. 
         
           Tywin nods again. 
         
        01:09:15:25  
                      TYWIN 
                   Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. 
                   Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and 
                   commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He 
                   was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by 
                   his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To

                   abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too 
                   gullible to recognize? 
         
        01:09:42:28  
                      TOMMEN 
                   No. 
         
        01:09:43:20 
                       TYWIN 
                   No. 
         
        01:09:47:19  
                      TOMMEN 
                   What about strength? 
         
           Tywin nods. 
         
        01:09:48:27 
                      TYWIN 
                   Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the 
                   rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And 
                   he attended three small council meetings in 17 
                   years. And he spent his time whoring and hunting 
                   and drinking until the last two killed him. So we 
                   have a man who starves himself to death, a man 
                   who lets his own brother murder him, and a man 
                   who thinks that winning and ruling are the same 
                   thing. What do they all lack? 
         
        01:10:34:07  
                      TOMMEN 
                   Wisdom. 
         
        01:10:34:28  
                      TYWIN 
                   Yes!  
         
        01:10:36:05  
                      TOMMEN 
                   Wisdom is what makes a good king. 
                    
            Cersei looks at Tommen.

        01:10:37:25 
                       TYWIN 
                   Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with 
                   great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your 
                   protection against another house with a strong 
                   navy that could one day oppose you. How do you 
                   know which choice is wise and which isn't? 
                   You’ve any experience of treasuries and 
                   granaries, or shipyards and soldiers? 
         
        01:11:04:24  
                      TOMMEN. 
                   No. 
         
        01:11:05:06 
                      TYWIN 
                   No, of course not. A wise king knows what he 
                   knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise 
                   young king listens to his counselors and heeds 
                   their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest 
                   kings continue to listen to them long afterwards.  
         
           Tywin glances at Joffrey. 
                    
        01:11:26:10 
                     TYWIN (cont.) 
                   Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother 
                   was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he’d 
                   still be alive.  
                    
           Cersei stares as Tywin speaks. Tywin makes eye contact with Cersei 
           as he leads Tommen away. 
         
        01:11:35:00 
                     TYWIN (cont.) 
                   Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you 
                   understand why? 
         
        01:11:41:00  
                      TOMMEN 
                   A king needs a queen. 
         
        01:11:42:13  
                      TYWIN 
                   Yes, but why? To further the family line.

           Cersei watches them go. 
         
        01:11:48:12 
                      TYWIN 
                   Do you know how that happens? 
         
        01:11:50:04 
                      TOMMEN 
                   Yes. 
         
        01:11:51:07  
                      TYWIN 
                   Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you? 
         
        01:11:55:00  
                      TOMMEN 
                   I don’t think so. 
         
        01:11:56:26  
                      TYWIN 
                   It's all relatively straightforward. 
                    
           Jaime meets Tywin and Tommen on the stairs.  
         
        01:12:00:10  
                       JAIME 
                   How are you? 
                    
        01:12:01:19 
                      TOMMEN 
                   I’m all right. 
         
        01:12:03:01  
                       JAIME 
                   You are. You will be.  
         
           Jaime puts his arm on Tommen’s shoulder.  
         
        01:12:04:27 
                     JAIME (cont.) 
                   I’ll see to that.  
                    
           Tywin and Tommen continue out of chapel. Jaime goes down the steps 
           to Cersei and Joffrey’s body. He addresses the septon.

                   Yes, my lord. 
                    
           Septon turns to snap his fingers. Jaime interrupts.

                   All of you.  
         
           Septon gives Jaime a look, then snaps his fingers. 
           All leave. Cersei stares at Joffrey.

                   It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. 
                   “A day will come when you think you are safe and 
                   happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your

           stare at the rabbit stew, struggling to get through the lengthy prayer.

                   We ask the Father to judge us with mercy, 
                   accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to 
                   bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and any 
                   and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior 
                   to give us courage in these days of strife and 
                   turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally’s

                   darkness to darkness.  
         
           Hound still stares at the stew. Impatient, he folds his hands in prayer 
           and interrupts Mortimer.

           Hound then reaches across the table, grabs the pot of stew and pours a 
           good amount into his bowl. He slams pot back down. Mortimer stares. 
           Arya apologizes to Mortimer.

                   wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it 
                   be if you stayed on ‘til the new moon? I could use 
                   a man to help with the farm work. Sally does what 
                   she can, but she can’t lift a bale of hay. And if any 
                   thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at 
                   you, I’d be they’d run the other way. Meaning no

                      Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of 
                      Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference 
                      between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem 
                      any more interested in the distinction than your 
                      father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of 
                      Braavos, and each one of our gold barges is worth 
                      half a kingdom – you tend not to be overly 
                      concerned with the kind of distinction –

           Gilly and Sam enter what will be Gilly’s quarters. Gilly looks at filthy 
           bedding.

                   I promise to come back and visit whenever I can.

                       SAM 
                   You’ll be safer here. Who’s gonna protect you at 
                   Castle Black? Me? 
         
        01:31:17:12  
                      GILLY 
                   You protected me north of the Wall. 
         
        01:31:19:11   
                       SAM 
                   This is different. They're Brothers of the Night’s 
                   Watch, and I can’t just stab them in the back. And 
                   I can’t run away, which is what we did at 
                   Craster’s.

                   You have to trust me. 
         
           Gilly grabs clean towel and lies it on bedding. 
         
        01:31:32:07  
                       SAM

                   (moaning) 
         
           Ellaria turns and kisses Olyvar, who looks confused. Oberyn smiles at 
           Ellaria. 
            
        01:32:19:25  
                      OBERYN 
                   You're greedy. 
         
           Ellaria kisses Olyvar again. He stops.  
         
        01:32:28:04  
                      ELLARIA 
                   No?

                      OLYVAR 
                   Sorry. You're lovely. I just never acquired the 
                   taste.

                   That's quite all right, lover. That’s more for you.

                   Your loss. 
         
           Oberyn sits up and grabs drink. Olyvar sits up.

                      OLYVAR 
                   You like them both the same? Boys and girls? 
         
           Oberyn puts drink down. Olyvar strokes his chest and stomach.

                      OBERYN

                   pleasure.

           Oberyn sits up and slaps Olyvar’s buttocks. He lies back down.

                    OBERYN (cont.)

                   wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of 
                   yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft, and 
                   your back will ache in the night. And gray hairs 
                   will sprout from your ears.

                      TYWIN 
                   You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the

                      OBERYN 
                   You are unarmed and unguarded because you 
                   know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I 
                   cut your throat today, I will be drawn and 
                   quartered tomorrow.

                      OBERYN 
                   So you deny involvement in Elia’s murder? 
         
        01:36:06:08  
                      TYWIN 
                   Categorically.

                   I would like to speak with the Mountain.

                      TYWIN 
                   I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you. 
         
         
        01:36:22:00 
                      OBERYN 
                   Might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would. 
         
        01:36:26:28  
                      TYWIN 
                   I could arrange for this meeting. 
         
        01:36:30:18 
                      OBERYN 
                   But you want something in return. 
         
        01:36:34:06  
                      TYWIN 
                   There will be a trial for my son. And as custom 
                   dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will 
                   preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second 
                   judge. I would like you to be the third. 
         
        01:36:48:20 
                      OBERYN  
                   Why? 
         
        01:36:49:29  
                      TYWIN 
                   Not long ago, they Tyrells sided with Renly 
                   Baratheon. Declared themselves enemy of the 
                   throne. Now they are our strongest allies. 
         
        01:36:58:20  
                      OBERYN 
                   Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking 
                   me to judge at your son’s trial isn't quite as 
                   tempting. 
                    
        01:37::05:07 
                      TYWIN 
                   I will also invite you to sit on the small council to 
                   serve as one of the new king’s principal advisors.

                   I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, 
                   Lord Tywin. 
         
        01:37:22:26  
                      TYWIN 
                   We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne 
                   returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys 
                   are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on 
                   the Wall. And in the east, a Targaryen girl has 
                   three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes 
                   to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist 
                   Aegon Targaryen and his dragons. 
         
        01:37:49:20 
                      OBERYN 
                   So you're saying you need us? That must be hard 
                   for you to admit. 
         
        01:37:56:22  
                      TYWIN 
                   We need each other. You help me serve justice 
                   to the king’s assassins, and I will help you serve 
                   justice to Elia’s.

                   Podrick. Apologies for the stench. 
         
        01:38:29:08  
                      PODRICK 
                   I brought you some wine, my lord. But they took 
                   it from me. 
         
        01:38:31:25  
                      TYRION 
                   A noble effort.

                   They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some

                   cheese.

        01:38:48:06  
                      PODRICK 
                   I’ve heard nothing, my lord. 
         
        01:38:50:08  
                      TYRION 
                   I suppose that's a good thing. What’re they 
                   saying about me out there?

                   You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering 
                   the king.

                      TYRION 
                   Do you believe I murdered Joffrey? 
         
        01:39:03:12 
                      PODRICK 
                   No, my lord.  
         
           Podrick cuts his eyes up to Tyrion.

                      PODRICK 
                   You didn't?

                   The world is a better place without him, but I had 
                   nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were 
                   arranging a royal assassination, I’d plan it in such a 
                   way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like 
                   a fool when the king died.

                      TYRION 
                   Of course.

                      TYRION 
                   Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to 
                   vote.

                   Give it to my father. He never fails to take 
                   advantage of a family tragedy. 
         
        01:39:51:18  
                      PODRICK 
                   I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my 
                   lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf. 
         
        01:39:58:00  
                      TYRION 
                   Oh, I can call my own witnesses?  
                    
           Podrick smiles. 
         
        01:40:00:11 
                      TYRION 
                   How generous of them. Very well. My wife, 
                   Sansa. 
         
        01:40:03:22  
                      PODRICK 
                   My lord, she’s gone. 
         
        01:40:05:27  
                      TYRION 
                   Gone? 
         
        01:40:06:23 
                      PODRICK 
                   No one’s seen her since the wedding. You don’t 
                   think she… 
         
           Tyrion thinks. He stands. 
         
        01:40:17:18  
                      TYRION 
                   No one had more cause to  kill Joffrey than Sansa, 
                   but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king 
                   wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my

                               EPISODE #403 (33) 
                   wife’s disappearance, it makes me seem that 
                   much more guilty. Podrick? 
         
         
        01:40:32:07 
                      PODRICK 
                   Yes, my lord? 
         
        01:40:33:00  
                      TYRION 
                   They’ll be following you now.

                   Who will? 
         
        01:40:34:15  
                      TYRION 
                   I don't know. They. They. Ominous they. The 
                   man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. 
                   Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet 
                   Tommen will be so much easier to handle. 
                   Whenever something bad happens to me, I 
                   assume it’s my sister that had a hand in it. But say 
                   what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. 
                   She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do 
                   with this murder. Which makes it unique, as 
                   Kings Landing murders go. 
         
        01:41:05:16  
                      PODRICK 
                   Any other witnesses, my lord? 
         
        01:41:08:02 
                      TYRION 
                   Varys could vouch for me if he dared. 
         
        01:41:10:01  
                      PODRICK 
                   He’s already been called as a witness for the 
                   queen. 
         
        01:41:11:27  
                      TYRION 
                   (overlap) Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for 
                   him.
