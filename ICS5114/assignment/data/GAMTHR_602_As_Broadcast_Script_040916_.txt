             Benjen nods. The two boys begin sparring again.

             Bran watches in disbelief. Around the courtyard, people work.

             Lyanna gallops into the courtyard on a horse.

             Bran smiles. Lyanna gallops, her long hair flying behind her. 
                                          
                             BRAN

             Bran watches in fascination.  
                                          
                           BRAN (CONT'D)

             Three-Eyed Raven's mouth moves, but he does not speak. He turns to the side, but Bran has 
             vanished.

             Lyanna dismounts from her horse and walks to the boys. Benjen addresses her irritably. 
                                          
                            BENJEN 
                     Would you get out of here? We're sparring.

             Lyanna's tone is mocking.    
                                          
                            LYANNA 
                 Who are you gonna spar with when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

             Now Benjen sounds glum.      
                                          
                            BENJEN 
                           I don't know.

             Lyanna turns her head to look into the distance. 
                                          
                            LYANNA 
                          What about him?

             Ned, smiling, follows her gaze. Bran stands looking at them without expression. 
                                          
        01:03:39:03                       
             Benjen, Ned, and Lyanna stand in a row facing Bran. Ned calls to him. 
                                          
                             NED

             Bran looks nervously over his shoulder. Hodor stands across the courtyard, holding the reins 
             of Lyanna's horse.

                  And you've got training. Sounds like a fair match to me.

             As Ned helps Benjen position his sword and shield, Lyanna speaks to Hodor in a low voice. 
                                          
                            LYANNA 
                   Benjen always lifts his chin when he's about to charge.

                            HODOR 
                    And lowers it when he's going to dodge, my lady.

             Bran, watching and listening, addresses Three-Eyed Raven with surprise. 
                                          
                             BRAN 
                           Hodor talks?

             Hodor crosses the courtyard, carrying sword and shield. He passes Bran and Three-Eyed 
             Raven.

             As Hodor stands in front of Benjen and raises his sword, Nan walks toward him, scolding.

             Hodor drops his sword. Nan grasps his ear and leads him away. Ned protests.

             Nan takes Hodor's shoulder and hustles him away. Three-Eyed Raven turns to Bran.

             A Leaf sits by Bran.

             Bran slightly rearranges his position.

                      I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.

             Hodor looks around. Bran continues to speak in an urgent tone.

                            Hodor.                                                                                                        
                         His real name is Wylis.

                     And he could talk and fight and-- and then--

             Meera turns around. She stares at Bran.

             Meera sighs and does not answer. Bran speaks gently.

             Meera gestures over her shoulder toward the cave.

             Bran doesn't reply. Meera turns away. Bran turns his head to look at Hodor, who steps 
             forward.

             Hodor lifts Bran and turns to walk to the cave entrance. Meera continues to gaze into the 
             distance.

             Meera turns her head. A Leaf sits among the snowy rocks and brush near the cave.

             The men ready themselves. Alliser picks up an axe. 
                              
             Inside, Davos and his men stand waiting. 
                              
             Alliser swings the axe at the door.

             Alliser continues hacking at the door. Davos and his men raise their swords and stand ready.

             The axe is beginning to break through the wood. Davos watches tensely.

             Alliser swings mercilessly at the door. The tension grows both inside and outside the room. 
        01:08:52:04           
                              
             The axe breaks through.

             At the sound of the thud, Alliser stops swinging the axe. He looks around. He and his men 
             look over the walkway railing; one sweeps a torch from side to side.

             The thudding comes from the far side of a huge set of doors. The archers raise their 
             crossbows, taking aim. Alliser watches from the walkway.

             As the men standing in the courtyard watch, their arrows at the ready, the huge doors fly off 
             their hinges. Wun Wun strides out, roaring. 
                              
             ( shouting )

             A group of armed Wildlings runs into the courtyard, shouting. The archers raise their arrows. 
             The Wildlings run toward them. Wun Wun walks with them. 
                              
        01:09:12:02           
                              
             Davos and his men now stand on the upper walkway. Davos raises his sword. 
                                          
                            DAVOS 
                            Attack!

             Chaos ensues in the courtyard. The Wildlings attack. Alliser stares as his men shuffle 
             backward.

             The men in the courtyard can be seen looking around. One archer standing on the walkway 
             lets fly an arrow. It hits Wun Wun. 
                                          
        01:09:27:02                       
                                          
             Wun Wun  growls and turns to look. The archer looks back. 
                                          
             ( growls )

             Wun Wun reaches up and grabs the archer. He pulls the archer from the walkway and 
             smashes his body against a stone wall. Then he throws the body aside. Alliser's men back up, 
             looking down in horror. Wun Wun breathes heavily. He growls. Alliser's men throw down 
             their weapons.

             Alliser looks around in frustration. Edd, leading a group of men, walks toward Alliser with his 
             sword extended. Alliser speaks with rage. 
                                          
                            ALLISER 
                          You fucking traitor.

             Davos and his men watch quietly from the walkway. Alliser growls.

             Tormund steps forward. His voice is low and harsh. 
                                          
                           TORMUND

             With a yell, Alliser raises his sword to fight.

             Before Alliser can act, several men disarm him and hold his arms behind his back. Edd steps 
             forward.

             An individual whose face cannot be seen approaches. The man turns to look. 
                              
             It is the Mountain. He smashes the man's head against the stone wall. The man falls to the 
             ground. The Mountain turns and walks away.

                  When they paraded her through the streets like a whore,

             Jaime is quietly reassuring.

             Tommen finally looks at Jaime. He speaks angrily.

             As the High Sparrow enters the room, Jaime puts a hand on Tommen's shoulder and whispers 
             advice. Then he turns to look at the High Sparrow.

             Jaime speaks without taking his eyes from the High Sparrow.

                       What atonement do I deserve? 
                                          
        01:17:21:21                       
                                          
             Jaime grips his sword hilt. The High Sparrow meets his eyes. 
                                          
        01:17:24:08                       
                          HIGH SPARROW 
                      You would spill blood in this holy place? 
                                          
        01:17:26:15                       
                                          
             Jaime's tone is ironic.      
                                          
                            JAIME 
                         Oh, the gods won't mind.

                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                  They've spilled more blood than the rest of us combined. 
                                          
        01:17:31:14                       
                                          
             The High Sparrow smiles. He straightens his posture. 
                                          
        01:17:33:12                       
                          HIGH SPARROW 
                           Go on, then. 
                                          
        01:17:35:20                       
                                          
             Jaime looks at him with suspicion.  
                                          
                        HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                         I deserve it. We all do.

                        HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                        We are weak, vain creatures.

             Both men turn their heads in the direction of the footsteps. All around them, Sparrows enter 
             the room. They are armed. Jaime looks back at the High Sparrow.

                  They should be closer if you mean for them to save you. 
                                          
        01:18:03:10

                        HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                     They'd never reach me before you struck.

                          HIGH SPARROW 
                       No doubt many of us would fall. 
                                          
        01:18:13:06                       
                        HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                         But who are we, hmm? 
                                          
        01:18:16:11                       
                                          
             Jaime looks around, appearing uneasy. 
                                          
                        HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                        We have no names, no family.

                      Every one of us is poor and powerless.

                        we can overthrow an empire.

             The High Sparrow takes a step back. He turns and walks away, leaving Jaime standing by 
             Myrcella's body.

             Cersei looks out the window at the city below. 
                              
             ( bird screeching )  
        01:18:49:11           
                              
             Cersei looks down at a golden necklace and pendant in her hand.

             Tommen enters the room. He speaks tentatively. 
                              
        01:18:58:15

             Cersei turns and walks to a table on the other side of the room. She puts down the necklace. 
                                          
        01:19:12:00                       
                            CERSEI 
                    Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?

             Cersei walks past Tommen, not looking at him.

                        Good. It was always her color.

             Cersei picks up a glass and drinks. Tommen turns to face her.

             Tommen's words stumble. He tries to continue.

             Cersei still has not turned to look at Tommen. He steps closer to her. 
                                          
        01:19:45:17

             Cersei's voice is distant. Tommen shakes his head. 
                                          
        01:19:57:14

                           No, it isn't.

             Cersei finally turns and looks into Tommen's face.

                       I should have executed all of them.

             The others listen. Tyrion walks over to Missandei.

                        And did they ever harm you?

             Tyrion looks around. Varys' question is sarcastic.

             Tyrion sounds confident.     
                                          
                            TYRION 
                     They will. It's time they had their supper.

             Tyrion and Varys stand at the top of the stairs. They hold torches and look nervous. Tyrion 
             slowly descends the stairs. 
                                          
        01:23:29:21                       
                                          
             Tyrion begins to walk across the floor. At the sound of scraping, he stops. 
                                          
             ( metal scraping, clanging )

             Nothing is visible. Tyrion continues walking.

             Tyrion approaches the dragons' room slowly and carefully. 
                                          
             ( growling )                 
        01:24:05:02                       
                                          
             Tyrion looks over his shoulder toward Varys. Then he turns back. 
                                          
             ( chains rattling )

             Tyrion holds his torch, waiting tensely. A dragon emerges. It opens its mouth and roars. 
                                          
        01:24:13:00

             Quickly, Tyrion backs off.   
                                          
        01:24:25:12                       
                                          
             The dragon roars. Then it seems to settle. Another dragon joins it. 
                              
             ( roars )        
        01:24:28:11           
                              
             Tyrion holds up a hand. He speaks gently, taking a step forward.

             A dragon pokes its snout toward Tyrion, who steps back. He continues to hold up his hand. 
                                          
        01:24:41:07

                          I'm here to help.

                     Don't eat the help. ( chuckles nervously ) 
                                          
        01:24:46:05                       
                                          
             The dragon does not respond well to this joke. It roars.

             Tyrion speaks in a quiet, persuasive voice, as if telling a story.

                   an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day.

                        I begged him for one of you.

                   It wouldn't even have to be a big dragon, I told him. 
                                          
        01:25:04:06

             Tyrion lies his torch on the ground. He straightens and looks at the dragon.

             The dragon appears to be listening.

             Tyrion puts out a careful hand. He touches the dragon.

             The dragon makes a low purring noise.

             Tyrion moves his hand to the iron collar around the dragon's neck. He pulls the pin. The collar 
             falls away.  Tyrion quickly steps back. 
                                          
        01:25:53:20                       
                                          
             Tyrion turns to find the other dragon looming over him.

             The dragon turns to one side, stretching out its neck to reveal its collar. Tyrion walks forward 
             and pulls the collar's pin. It falls to the floor. The dragon stirs and stretches. Tyrion picks up 
             his torch. He rapidly crosses the room and climbs the stairs. He arrives next to Varys, 
             sounding breathless.

             Tyrion leaves. Varys follows.

             Arya scrambles to her feet, tossing aside her begging bowl and picking up her own staff.

             Arya is headed the wrong direction. At the sound of the Waif's voice, she turns. 
                                          
                             WAIF

             Arya runs at the Waif, trips on a step, and falls. She stands, picking up her staff.

             Arya swings all around, hitting nothing. The Waif is gone. Arya swings one more time. A hand 
             reaches out and grabs her staff. Jaqen addresses her.

             Theon carries an armload of wood between the snowy trees. When Brienne speaks, he turns 
             to look at her.

             Theon drops his load of wood by Pod, who is building a fire. Then he kneels. Sansa and 
             Brienne sit a little ways away. Sansa listens as Brienne talks. Theon stands and walks into the 
             woods.

             Sansa is wrapped in a blanket. Her eyes are wide.

                      She wasn't exactly dressed like a lady.

             Balon turns away. Yara continues, sounding more heated. 
                                          
                           YARA (CONT'D)

                       and knocked down our towers.

                        I lost two brothers that day.

             Balon turns on her. He shouts.  
                                          
                            BALON 
                         And I lost three sons.

                        Well, the other four are dead.

             Balon steps close to Yara, glaring into her face.

             Balon walks past Yara. She turns to watch him go.

             Balon starts to cross the rope bridge to another tower. The bridge moves and creaks with the 
             storm. Balon clutches the rope railings. He raises his head and sees a dark figure at the other 
             end of the bridge. He calls out.

                         And you're in my way.

             The brothers stare at each other. Balon draws a knife. Euron grabs him and throws him over 
             the side of the bridge. Balon plunges into the water far below.

             Euron looks over the side of the bridge. He steadies himself, breathing hard.

             A group of people stand on the shore to lay Balon to rest. Standard bearers fly flags. Balon's 
             face is covered. Yara walks up as the priest begins to speak. Several men take Balon's body, 
             on a raft, into the water.

             The surf takes the raft holding Balon's body. The bearers turn to wade back to shore.

                   I'm going to feed them to the sharks while they live.

             As she speaks, an old man turns to listen.

             The old man's tone is hard.  
                                          
                            OLD MAN 
                   Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear.

             Yara and the old man glare at each other. Finally he speaks. 
                                          
        01:43:43:18

                          And perhaps not. 
                                          
        01:43:52:07                       
                                          
             The old man walks away. Yara looks out to sea. The raft floats deeper.

             Melisandre sits in a chair by the fireplace. When the knock comes, she answers quietly.

             The door opens to reveal Davos.

                     I'm sorry, my lady. Didn't mean to interrupt.

                         You interrupt nothing.

             Davos walks closer to Melisandre. She stares into the fire. 
                                          
        01:44:34:14

                         I will after you tell me. 
                                          
        01:44:40:15                       
                            DAVOS 
                       It's about the Lord Commander.

             Finally, Melisandre looks up.

             Davos seems to be struggling to speak.

                       There are some with this power.

        01:45:16:18                       
                            DAVOS 
                         Have you seen it done?

             Melisandre pauses. Then she answers. 
                                          
        01:45:21:04                       
                           MELISANDRE 
                     I met a man who came back from the dead, 
                                          
        01:45:23:16                       
                         MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                        but the priest who did it-- 
                                          
        01:45:26:21                       
                         MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                       it shouldn't have been possible.

             Davos speaks urgently.       
                                          
                            DAVOS 
                        But it was. It could be now. 
                                          
        01:45:32:01                       
                           MELISANDRE 
                           Not for me. 
                                          
        01:45:34:10                       
                                          
             Melisandre stands and walks across the room. Davos walks after her. 
                                          
        01:45:38:13                       
                            DAVOS 
                           Not for you? 
                                          
        01:45:40:15                       
                                          
                                          
                                          
        01:45:44:10                       
                            DAVOS 
                   I saw you drink poison that should have killed you. 
                                          
        01:45:48:04                       
                          DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                   I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows. 
                                          
        01:45:51:06                       
                                          
             Melisandre sounds tired and defeated. 
                                          
                           MELISANDRE 
                         Everything I believed, 
                                          
        01:45:54:01                       
                         MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                      the great victory I saw in the flames, 
                                          
        01:45:57:11                       
                         MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                          all of it was a lie.

             Melisandre turns to Davos, tearful.  
                                          
        01:46:03:10                       
                           MELISANDRE 
                         You were right all along. 
                                          
        01:46:05:12                       
                         MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                        The Lord never spoke to me. 
                                          
        01:46:08:06                       
                            DAVOS 
                           Fuck him, then. 
                                          
        01:46:10:07                       
                          DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                          Fuck all of them. 
                                          
        01:46:14:02                       
                            DAVOS 
                       I'm not a devout man, obviously. 
                                          
        01:46:17:22                       
                          DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                   Seven gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same. 
                                          
        01:46:21:03                       
                                          
             Davos steps next to Melisandre. His voice is intense. 
                                          
        01:46:24:07                       
                            DAVOS 
                      I'm not asking the Lord of Light for help. 
                                          
        01:46:27:05                       
                          DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                  I'm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist. 
                                          
        01:46:31:14                       
                                          
             Melisandre looks at him. She shakes her head. 
                                          
        01:46:33:13                       
                           MELISANDRE 
                          I never had this gift.

                         Have you ever tried? 
                                          
        01:46:37:19                       
             Melisandre looks away. She does not speak.

             Melisandre stands over Jon's nude body. Davos and other men stand nearby. Melisandre 
             wipes Jon's skin with a damp cloth. She cleans his wounds. 
                                          
             ( speaking Valyrian )

             As Melisandre speaks, she uses a pair of scissors to snip a lock of Jon's hair. As Davos watches 
             intently, she throws the hair into a brazier. 
                                          
        01:48:03:01

             As the men watch, Melisandre continues to cut Jon's hair. She throws each handful onto the 
             fire. Then she begins to cut Jon's beard. That hair she also puts on the fire. 
                                          
        01:48:31:10                       
                                          
             Melisandre lifts a pitcher. She pours water over Jon's head, stroking what remains of his hair. 
                                          
             ( continues speaking Valyrian )  
        01:48:36:00           
                              
             The men watch quietly. Melisandre extends her hands over Jon's torso, palms down. She 
             rests her hands on his body. 
                              
        01:49:18:23

             Melisandre hesitates. She glances toward Davos. Then she presses her hands against Jon's 
             wounds again and continues to speak. She repeats a phrase several times; each time she 
             glances at Jon's still face. 
                              
        01:50:06:17           
                              
             Davos watches in silence. He looks toward Tormund, then looks back. 
                              
             ( continues faintly )  
        01:50:09:22           
                              
                              
                              
        01:50:20:14           
                              
             Melisandre takes a deep breath. She closes her eyes and then opens them, looking sad. 
                                          
                           MELISANDRE 
                            Please. 
             ( sighs )                    
        01:50:23:02                       
                                          
             Melisandre removes her hands from Jon's torso. She turns and looks at Davos in despair. 
                                          
        01:50:59:10

             Tormund leaves the room. Melisandre steps away from Jon's body. Ghost lies sleeping on the 
             floor.

             Davos looks down at Jon's body for a long moment. Then he too leaves the room. The door 
             closes. 
                                          
             Ghost opens his eyes and lifts his head. 
                                          
             Suddenly, Jon's eyes open. He gasps.
