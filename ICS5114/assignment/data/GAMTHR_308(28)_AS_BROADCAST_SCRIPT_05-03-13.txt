           Arya is lying on the ground, staring at a rock.  She looks over 
           at The Hound.  She picks up the rock. 
            
      [MUSIC IN] 
           The Hound is sleeping by a tree.  Arya slowly moves towards The 
           Hound.  She looks down at him and raises the rock above her 
           head. 
            
      01:02:29 
                          HOUND

                   ...one try, girl. 
           The Hound looks up at Arya. 
                          HOUND (CONT'D) 
                   Kill me and you're free.  But if I 
                   live, I'll break both your hands.  Go 
                   on, hit me. 
                    
                          HOUND (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Hit me hard. 
           EXT. RED FORK - HILL - DAY. 
            
           The Hound is on horseback with Arya sitting in front.  The Hound 
           grabs an apple and takes a bite.  He offers Arya the apple and 
           she stares at it.  The Hound shakes his head. 
                          HOUND (CONT'D) 
                   Sulk all you want.  The truth is, 
                   you're lucky.  You don't want to be 
                   alone out here, girl.  Someone worse 
                   than me would find you.

                          HOUND 
                   Ha, you never knew my brother.  He once 
                   killed a man for snoring.  There's 
                   plenty worse than me.  There's men who 
                   like to beat little girls, men who like 
                   to rape them.  I saved your sister from 
                   some of them. 
      01:03:27      
                          ARYA 
                   You're lying. 
      01:03:28      
                          HOUND 
                   Ask her, if you ever see her again.  
                   Ask her who came back for her when the 
                   mob had her on her back.  They would 
                   have taken her every which way and left 
                   her there with her throat cut open. 
           The Hound and Arya turn towards a river. 
            
      01:03:47 
                          ARYA 
                   Is that the Blackwater? 
      01:03:48      
                          HOUND 
                   The Blackwater?  Where do you think I'm 
                   taking you? 
           Arya looks at The Hound.

                   the Queen. 
      01:03:58      
                          HOUND 
                   Fuck Joffrey.  Fuck the Queen.  That's 
                   the Red Fork.  I'm taking you to the 
                   Twins. 
      01:04:07

                   But why? 
      01:04:08      
                          HOUND 
                   Because your mother and brother will be 
                   there and they'll pay me for you.

                   Why would they be at the Twins? 
      01:04:17      
                          HOUND 
                   (chuckles) Those outlaws you love so 
                   much never told you?  The whole 
                   countryside is yapping about it.  Your 
                   uncle is marrying one of the Frey 
                   girls.  So quit trying to bash my skull 
                   in and we might just make it there in 
                   time for the wedding. 
           The horse trots forward.  Arya smiles.

           The Second Sons are riding on their horses towards their camp.  
           Jorah, Daenerys and Barristan are observing them behind a wall 
           from afar.  The Unsullied are behind them.

                   Only by the broken swords on their 
                   banners.  They're called the Second 
                   Sons.  A company led by a Braavosi 
                   named Mero, "The Titan's Bastard."

                          DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                   It's hard to collect wages from a 
                   corpse.  I'm sure the sellswords prefer 
                   to fight for the winning side. 
           Jorah nods.

                          DAENERYS 
                   He will.  A man who fights for gold 
                   can't afford to lose to a girl.

           Daario bows slightly.  Daenerys is seated in front of them.  
           Missandei is standing to her far right.  Barristan steps aside.  
           Mero moves forward.

                   What do you mean to do with him? 
      01:10:19      
                          MELISANDRE 
                   You know what I mean to do with him. 
      01:10:21      
                          STANNIS

                   Then why bathe him and dress him in      
                   fine clothes?  If it needs to be done, 
                   do it.  Don't torture the boy. 
      01:10:26      
                          MELISANDRE 
                   Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, My 
                   King? 
      01:10:29      
                          STANNIS 
                   No. 
      01:10:31      
                          MELISANDRE 
                   If the lamb sees the knife, she panics.  
                   Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens 
                   it, fouls the flavor. 
      01:10:40      
                          STANNIS 
                   You've slaughtered many lambs? 
      01:10:43      
                          MELISANDRE 
                   And none have seen the blade. 
           Melisandre walks out of the chamber.

           Davos is sitting in his cell, trying to read a book.

           Stannis walk towards Davos' cell.  Davos hides his book in a 
           bag.  Davos stands. 
                          DAVOS 
                   Your Grace. 
      01:11:56      
                          STANNIS 
                   They feeding you enough? 
      01:11:58      
                          DAVOS (OS) 
                   Two meals a day. 
                    
                          DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                   Cold for breakfast, hot for supper.  I 
                   cannot complain. 
      01:12:05      
                          STANNIS 
                   You don't belong in a place like this. 
      01:12:07      
                          DAVOS 
                   Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen 
                   worse. 
           Stannis looks around the dungeon. 
            
      01:12:11 
                          STANNIS 
                   Yeah.

                          STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   I'm sorry about your son. 
                    
                          STANNIS (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Didn't get the chance to tell you 
                   before. 
                    
                          STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   Good lad.  Loyal lad. 
           Davos nods. 
                          STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   Melisandre's returned. 
      01:12:31      
                          DAVOS 
                   I didn't know she'd been gone. 
      01:12:33      
                          STANNIS 
                   Came back with a bastard boy.  Robert's 
                   bastard boy. 
      01:12:38      
                          DAVOS 
                   Why? 
      01:12:40      
                          STANNIS 
                   She says there's power in king's blood. 
      01:12:45      
                          DAVOS 
                   She's going to kill him. 
      01:12:46      
                          STANNIS 
                   Sacrifice him.

      01:12:47 
                          DAVOS 
                   Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a 
                   learned man, but is there a difference 
                   between kill and sacrifice?  The boy is 
                   your nephew. 
      01:12:54      
                          STANNIS 
                   What of it?  We're at war.  Why should 
                   I spare the son of some tavern slut 
                   Robert bedded one drunken night? 
      01:13:03      
                          DAVOS 
                   Because he has your blood in his veins. 
      01:13:07      
                          STANNIS 
                   So did Renly. 
      01:13:10      
                          DAVOS 
                   Renly wronged you.  Renly declared 
                   himself king when the throne belonged 
                   to you.  He raised an army, stole your 
                   bannermen.  This boy has done you no 
                   harm.  He's an innocent. 
      01:13:20      
                          STANNIS (OS) 
                   How many boys live in Westeros? 
                    
                          STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   How many girls?  How many men?  How 
                   many women?  The darkness will devour 
                   them all, she says.  The night that 
                   never ends.  Unless I triumph.  I never 
                   asked for this.  No more than I asked 
                   to be king.  We do not choose our

      01:13:52      
                          DAVOS 
                   Your Grace, why did you come to see me 
                   today? 
      01:13:58      
                          STANNIS 
                   I came to free you.  If you swear never 
                   to raise your hand to the Lady 
                   Melisandre again. 
      01:14:04      
                          DAVOS 
                   I swear it.  I can't swear never to 
                   speak against her. 
      01:14:09      
                          STANNIS 
                   You have little regard for your own 
                   life. 
      01:14:11      
                          DAVOS 
                   Quite little, Your Grace.  Verging on 
                   none.  You could have freed me 
                   yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to 
                   me now before this boy is put to the 
                   knife...

                          DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                   ...because you knew I'd counsel 
                   restraint.  You came to hear me say it 
                   because you believe it yourself.  
                   You're not a man who slaughters

           Davos moves closer to Stannis. 
                          DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                   When my son was five he said to me, "I 
                   don't ever want to die."  I wanted to 
                   say to him, "You won't, child.  You 
                   won't ever." 
                    
                          DAVOS (CONT'D - OS) 
                   I hated the idea of him lying awake in 
                   the dark, afraid. 
                    
                          DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                   I think mothers and fathers made up the 
                   gods because they wanted their children 
                   to sleep through the night.

                          STANNIS 
                   I saw a vision in the flames.  A great 
                   battle in the snow.  I saw it.  And you 
                   saw whatever she gave birth to. 
                    
                          STANNIS (CONT'D - OS) 
                   I never believed, but when you see the 
                   truth, when it's right there... 
                    
                          STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   ...in front of you as real as these 
                   iron bars, how can you deny her god is 
                   real?

                   We're going to be sisters soon.  We 
                   should be friends.

           Cersei and Margaery walk together.

                   A better dancer than a singer, I'm 
                   afraid.

                          CERSEI 
                   Ah, but you know the song "The Rains of

      01:20:49      
                          MARGAERY 
                   Of course.  They play it so often here 
                   at court.

                          MARGAERY

                   House Reyne was a powerful family.       
                   Very wealthy.  The second wealthiest in 
                   Westeros.

           Cersei and Margaery stop at the bottom of the stairs. 
                          CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   Aren't the Tyrells the second 
                   wealthiest family in Westeros now?  Of 
                   course, ambitious climbers don't want 
                   to stop on the second highest rung.  If 
                   only you could take that final step, 
                   you'd see further than all the rest.  
                   You'd be alone with nothing but blue 
                   sky above you.  So Lord Reyne built a 
                   castle as grand as Casterly Rock.  He 
                   gave his wife diamonds larger than any 
                   my mother ever wore.  And finally one 
                   day, he rebelled against my father.  Do 
                   you know where House Reyne is now?

                   Gone.  A gentle word.  Why not say 
                   slaughtered?  Every man, woman, and 
                   child put to the sword.  I remember... 
           Cersei and Margery continue walking. 
                          Cersei (CONT'D) 
                   ...seeing their bodies hanging high 
                   above the gates of Casterly Rock.  My 
                   father let them rot up there all 
                   summer.  It was a long summer.  "And 
                   now the rains weep o'er their halls, 
                   and not a soul to hear." 
           Cersei and Margaery stop.  Cersei turns to Margaery.

                   have you strangled in your sleep. 
           Cersei walks away.  The doors of the hall open.  Sansa walks 
           through the doors. 
            
      [MUSIC IN] 
           Tyrion is across the hall waiting for Sansa.  Joffrey approaches 
           from the side flanked by his Kingsguard.  Joffrey stands beside 
           Sansa. 
            
      01:22:48 
                          JOFFREY 
                   (breathes deeply)

                          SANSA 
                   What are you doing? 
      01:22:52      
                          JOFFREY 
                   Your father's gone.  As the father of 
                   the realm, it is my duty to give you 
                   away to your husband. 
           Sansa takes Joffrey's arm and they walk down the stairs.  The 
           doors to the hall close.  Joffrey and Sansa walk down the aisle 
           where the nobles are gathered.  Bronn is in the crowd and nods 
           at them.  Margaery and Loras nod at Sansa.  Cersei and Tywin are 
           on the side.  Sansa and Joffrey reach the top of the stairs.  
           Joffrey grabs Tyrion's step stool and walks down the stairs.  
           Tyrion is holding the ceremonial cloak.

                   her under your protection. 
           Sansa offers her back to Tyrion.  Tyrion opens the cloak and 
           attempts to put it on Sansa.

           Tyrion looks up at Sansa.  Sansa turns to Tyrion.

                          TYRION

           Sansa kneels and Tyrion puts the cloak on her. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   Thank you. 
           Sansa stands up.  Tyrion and Sansa turn towards the High Septon.

           INT. DRAGONSTONE KEEP - GENDRY'S CHAMBER - DAY. 
            
           Gendry is in a chamber filled with candles.  He walks towards an 
           unlit fire stand.  Melisandre enters carrying a sealed box. 
            
      01:25:48 
                          MELISANDRE 
                   Have you ever seen one like it? 
      01:25:50      
                          GENDRY 
                   I've never seen anything like any of 
                   this. 
           Melisandre puts the box on a table next to the bed. 
                          GENDRY (CONT'D) 
                   Not in my life.

                          MELISANDRE 
                   It's shocking, isn't it, the first time 
                   you encounter real wealth? 
           Melisandre walks to a table and picks up a taper.

                          MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   When I was your age, I lived on one 
                   bowl of stew a day.  And stew is a kind 
                   word for it. 
           Melisandre lights the taper. 
            
      01:26:06 
                          GENDRY (OS) 
                   In Flea Bottom... 
                    
                          GENDRY (CONT'D) 
                   ...we called them bowls of brown. 
           Melisandre walks to the brazier and lights it up with the taper. 
                          GENDRY (CONT'D) 
                   We'd pretend that the meat in them was 
                   chicken.  We knew it wasn't chicken.

                   (blows) 
           Melisandre walk towards a table.  She then pours Gendry a cup of 
           wine. 
                          MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   Here... 
           Melisandre turns to Gendry and offers him the cup. 
                          MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   ...taste this.  You think I'm trying to 
                   poison you? 
      01:26:41      
                          GENDRY 
                   (chuckles) 
           Melisandre takes a sip.  Gendry moves closer to Melisandre and 
           takes the cup and drinks from it.

                   That's good.  (chuckles) 
           Gendry drinks again. 
                          GENDRY (CONT'D) 
                   That's really good. 
      01:27:03      
                          MELISANDRE (OS) 
                   Where do you think it's from? 
           Gendry shakes his head. 
            
      01:27:06 
                          GENDRY 
                   I couldn't even guess. 
      01:27:07      
                          MELISANDRE (OS) 
                   Doesn't matter... 
                    
                          MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   ...does it?  It's the real thing or 
                   it's not.  You only need a tongue to 
                   tell the difference. 
           Melisandre turns to the table but abruptly turns back to Gendry. 
                          MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   Go on, have some more. 
           Melisandre turns to the table.  Melisandre turns to Gendry. 
                          MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   (chuckles) You still don't trust it.  
                   You think this is all a mistake and 
                   that you'll have to pay somehow for 
                   every bite you take.

                   mind, yeah. 
           Melisandre caresses Gendry's cheeks. 
                          MELISANDRE 
                   There are no mistakes.  Not for us. 
      01:27:39      
                          GENDRY 
                   I'm a mistake. 
           Melisandre takes the cup from Gendry and finishes it. 
                          GENDRY (CONT'D) 
                   I'm only here because my father

           Melisandre sets the cup down. 
                          GENDRY (CONT'D) 
                   ...my mother instead of the girl next 
                   to her in the tavern. 
      01:27:46      
                          MELISANDRE 
                   Your father chose your mother because 
                   the Lord of Light willed it.  He willed 
                   it... 
           Melisandre moves closer to Gendry. 
                          MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   ...so you could be here right now with 
                   a power inside you you can't even begin 
                   to understand. 
           Melisandre kisses Gendry and begins to loosen his clothes. 
                          MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   And He brought me here to draw it from 
                   you and birth it into the world. 
           Melisandre whispers in Gendry's ear.

                   We're both a part of His plan.  He 
                   wants this for us.  No, He demands this 
                   of us. 
           Melisandre kisses Gendry and takes off his shirt.

                          GENDRY 
                   I don't understand.  This doesn't seem 
                   very religious. 
      01:28:25      
                          MELISANDRE 
                   According to whom?  The Silent Sisters?  
                   With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, 
                   and dried-up cunts?  What have their 
                   gods done for you?  Hmm? 
           Melisandre holds Gendry's cheek. 
                          MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   When you pray to them, what's their 
                   answer?  A god is real... 
           Melisandre begins to take off her clothes.

                   see. 
           Melisandre caresses Gendry's head. 
                          MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   Death is coming for everyone and 
                   everything.  A darkness that will 
                   swallow the dawn.  And we can stop it, 
                   you and I. 
           Melisandre leads Gendry to the side of the bed.  She starts 
           kissing Gendry and pushes him onto the bed.  She pulls off his 
           breeches.

                   you. 
           Melisandre kisses Gendry. 
                          MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   Come fight death with me. 
           Melisandre and Gendry start to copulate.

                   (moaning) 
           Gendry grabs Melisandre's breasts.  Melisandre holds Gendry's 
           hands and puts them over his head.  She then ties both his hands 
           to the bed.

                          GENDRY

           She quickly straps both of Gendry's feet.  She moves to the  
           table beside the bed and opens the sealed box.  She takes a pair 
           of tweezers and takes a leech out from the box. 
                          GENDRY (CONT'D) 
                   (panting) 
           Melisandre puts the leech on Gendry's chest. 
                          GENDRY (CONT'D) 
                   What--?  Get it away.  Get it off me. 
           Melisandre takes another leech.

                          MELISANDRE 
                   Don't fight, don't fight.  They won't 
                   take much. 
           Melisandre puts the leech onto Gendry's stomach. 
            
      01:30:49 
                          GENDRY 
                   Why are you doing this? 
      01:30:51      
                          MELISANDRE 
                   I told you there's power in the blood 
                   of kings.  And you have so much blood. 
           Melisandre takes another leech.

                          GENDRY 
                   No.  No, no, no, no!  Not there. 
           Melisandre puts it onto Gendry's genitals.

                          MELISANDRE 
                   You can blame Ser Davos.  He didn't 
                   believe in the power of king's blood. 
           Stannis and Davos enter the room.  Melisandre puts on her 
           clothes. 
                          MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   He wanted a demonstration.

                   Please.  Please, Your Grace.  My Lord! 
           Melisandre walks over to the table beside the bed, carrying a 
           cup.  She takes the tweezers and removes the leeches and puts it 
           into the cup.

                   his own wedding?

                   This isn't about your wedding.  Renly    
                   Baratheon had a wedding.  Your wife 
                   needs a child, a Lannister child, as 
                   soon as possible. 
      01:34:23      
                          TYRION 
                   And? 
      01:34:24      
                          TYWIN 
                   If you're going to give her one, you 
                   need to perform. 
      01:34:28      
                          TYRION 
                   What did you once call me?  A drunken 
                   little lust-filled beast. 
      01:34:34      
                          TYWIN 
                   More than once. 
      01:34:34      
                          TYRION (OS) 
                   There you have it.  Nothing to worry 
                   about. 
                    
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   Drinking and lust, no man... 
                    
                          TYRION (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...can match me in these things.  I am 
                   the god... 
                    
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   ...of tits and wine.  I shall build a 
                   shrine to myself at the next brothel I 
                   visit. 
           Tyrion tries to drink from his cup.  Tywin grabs Tyrion's cup 
           and puts it on the table, spilling it.

                          TYWIN 
                   You can drink, you can joke, you can 
                   engage in juvenile... 
           Tyrion spits. 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   ...attempts to make your father 
                   uncomfortable, but you will do your 
                   duty. 
           Tywin flicks the wine off his hand.  Tywin looks at the Tyrells.  
           He then walks towards his chair.  Loras is looking down at 
           Tyrion from the railing of the second floor.  Tyrion raises his 
           cup at Loras.  Loras looks over to Cersei.  He then walks over 
           to her. 
            
      01:35:42 
                          LORAS 
                   Well...my father once told me... 
      01:35:48      
                          CERSEI 
                   Nobody cares what your father once told 
                   you. 
           Cersei walks away.  Sansa walks up the stairs with Shae beside 
           her.  Shae pulls the curtains aside to let Sansa pass into the 
           hallway.  Shae sees Joffrey and moves aside. 
            
      [MUSIC IN] 
           Joffrey grabs Sansa's arm.  The Kingsguard follows them. 
            
      01:36:14 
                          JOFFREY 
                   Congratulations, My Lady. 
           Sansa and Joffrey turn around.

                   Thank you, Your Grace. 
           Sansa and Joffrey walk back to the dinning hall. 
            
      01:36:18 
                          JOFFREY 
                   Well, you've done it.  You've married a 
                   Lannister.  Soon you'll have a 
                   Lannister baby.  It's a dream come true 
                   for you, isn't it?  What a glorious 
                   day. 
           Joffrey steps in front of Sansa. 
            
      01:36:27 
                          SANSA 
                   Yes, Your Grace. 
      01:36:29      
                          JOFFREY 
                   I suppose it doesn't really matter 
                   which Lannister puts the baby into you.  
                   Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight 
                   after my uncle passes out.  How'd you 
                   like that?  You wouldn't?  That's all 
                   right.  Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will 
                   hold you down. 
           Joffrey steps back and faces the dinning hall. 
                          JOFFREY 
                   (claps) Time for the bedding ceremony.

      01:36:58      
                          JOFFREY 
                   Where's your respect for tradition, 
                   Uncle? 
           Joffrey motions to the people. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   Come, everyone. 
           The people gather. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   Pick her up and carry her to her 
                   wedding bed. 
           Joffrey stops in front of Tyrion's table and turns to Sansa. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   Get rid of her gown.  She won't be 
                   needing it any longer. 
           Joffrey signals the women to come. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   Ladies, attend to my uncle.  He's not 
                   heavy. 
      01:37:11

                   There will be... 
           Joffrey turns to Tyrion. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   ...no bedding ceremony. 
      01:37:13      
                          JOFFREY 
                   There will be if I command it.

           Joffrey turns to the people.  Tyrion drives a small knife into  
           the table.  Joffrey turns to Tyrion. 
            
      01:37:18 
                          TYRION 
                   Then you'll be fucking your own bride 
                   with a wooden cock. 
           Tywin stands up. 
            
      01:37:26 
                          JOFFREY 
                   What did you say? 
           Joffrey moves closer to Tyrion. 
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   What did you say?!  (breathes heavily) 
      01:37:37      
                          TYWIN (OS) 
                   I believe we can dispense... 
                    
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   ...with the bedding, Your Grace. 
                    
                          TYWIN (CONT'D - OS) 
                   I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to 
                   threaten the King. 
      01:37:50      
                          TYRION 
                   (laughs) 
           Tyrion let's go of the knife. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   A bad joke, Your Grace.  Made out of 
                   envy... 
           Tyrion taps on the knife. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D)

           Tyrion sits up and looks down at his groin. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   ...is so small. 
                    
                          TYRION (CONT'D - OS) 
                   My poor wife won't even know I'm there. 
      01:38:05      
                          TYWIN 
                   Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your 
                   Grace. 
           Joffrey looks at Tywin. 
            
      01:38:09 
                          TYRION (OS) 
                   I am.  Guilty. 
           Tyrion drinks from his cup. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   But... 
           Tyrion gets off from his chair. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   ...but it is my wedding night.  My tiny 
                   drunk cock and I have a job to do. 
           Tyrion staggers and bumps into a table. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   Come, wife. 
           Tyrion holds his arm out towards Sansa.  Tyrion signals Sansa to 
           follow him.  Tyrion walks away and Sansa follows him. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   I... 
           Tyrion turns to Sansa.

                   of the act.  Not proud of it.  But I 
                   think honesty is important between a 
                   man and wife, don't you agree?  Come, 
                   I'll tell you all about it. 
                    
                          TYRION (CONT'D - OS) 
                   Put you in the mood. 
           INT. RED KEEP - TYRION AND SANSA'S CHAMBER - NIGHT. 
            
           Tyrion opens the door and let's Sansa in.  Sansa walks in and 
           turns to Tyrion.  Tyrion closes the door and turns to Sansa.  
           Tyrion staggers towards a table.  He pours himself a drink. 
            
      01:39:20 
                          SANSA 
                   Is that wise, My Lord? 
      01:39:22      
                          TYRION 
                   Tyrion, Sansa.  My name is Tyrion.

                          SANSA 
                   Is that wise, Tyrion? 
           Tyrion sets the bottle down and turns to Sansa. 
            
      01:39:35 
                          TYRION 
                   Nothing was... 
           Tyrion raises his cup to Sansa. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   ...ever wiser. 
           Tyrion staggers to sit on the couch and looks at Sansa.  Sansa 
           looks around the room.

           Tyrion points at Sansa. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   ...one.  How old are you exactly?

                   Well, talk won't make you any older. 
           Tyrion stands up.

                   My Lord father has commanded me to 
                   consummate this marriage. 
           Sansa walks to the table. 
            
      [MUSIC IN] 
           She pours herself a cup of wine.  She then drinks it.  Tyrion 
           raises his glass to Sansa and drinks.  Sansa puts the glass down 
           and walks towards the bed. She starts taking off her clothes.  
           Tyrion stands behind a bedroom screen.  He then moves to the 
           side.

                   Stop. 
           Sansa turns to Tyrion.  Tyrion shakes his head. 
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   I can't.  I could, I won't.  (laughs) 
      01:41:55

                   But your father... 
      01:41:56      
                          TYRION (OS) 
                   If my father... 
                    
                          TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   ...wants someone to get fucked, I know 
                   where he can start.  I won't share your 
                   bed.  Not until you want me to. 
           Sansa moves closer to Tyrion. 
            
      01:42:16 
                          SANSA 
                   What if I never want you to? 
           Tyrion raises his cup to Sansa.

                          TYRION 
                   And so my watch begins. 
           Tyrion drinks from his cup.  Tyrion staggers to the couch and 
           falls asleep.

                   It only took Your Grace a year to learn 
                   Dothraki reasonably well.

           Missandei picks up a pitcher. 
                          MISSANDEI (CONT'D) 
                   So guttural and harsh. 
           Missandei pours it over Daenerys.

                   Drogo said I spoke Dothraki like one 
                   born to it.  It gave him great pride.
