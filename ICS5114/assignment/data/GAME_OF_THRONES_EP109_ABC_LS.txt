                        courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me
                        the honor of shutting their mouths.

               LORD WALDER STANDS UP.
                                    LORD WALDER
                        You see that? Fifteen, she is. A
                        little flower and her honey's all mine.

                        I'm sure she will give you many sons.
                                    LORD WALDER
                        Huh. Your father didnâ€™t come to the
                        wedding.
                                    CATELYN
                        He is quite ill, my Lord.

                        Huh. Didnâ€™t come to the last one,
                        either.  Or the one before that. Your
                        family has always pissed on me.
                                    CATELYN

                        Donâ€™t deny it. You know it's true. The
                        fine Lord Tully would never marry any of
                        his children to mine.

                        I'm sure there were reasons.
                                    LORD WALDER
                        I didnâ€™t need reasons. I needed to get
                        rid of sons and daughters. You see how
                        they pile up? Why are you here?

                        To ask you to open your gates, my lord,
                        so my son and his bannermen may cross
                        the Trident and be on their way.

                            LORD WALDER
                   They'll be twenty thousand corpses when
                   Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try to
                   frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husband's
                   in a cell beneath the Red Keep, and your
                   sons got no fur to keep his balls warm.
                            CATELYN
                   You swore an oath to my father.
                            LORD WALDER
                   Oh yes.I said some words.Then I
                   swore oaths to the crown, too, if I
                   remember right. Joffrey's king now,
                   which makes your boy and his corpses-to-
                   be nothing but rebels, it seems to me.
                   If I had the sense the Gods gave a fish,
                   I'd hand you both over to the

                        I thought a wolf was more appropriate
                        for you than a bear, so I had a new
                        pommel made.  It's called Longclaw.
                        Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I
                        think.

                        It was my father's sword. His father
                        before him. The Mormont's have carried
                        it for five centuries. It was meant for
                        my son, Jorah. He brought dishonor to
                        our house, but he had the grace to leave
                        the sword before he fled for Westeros.

                        What is honor compared to a woman's
                        love? What is duty against the feel of

                        when there's no cost to it. Honor comes
                        easy then. Yet, sooner or later, in

                   Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone
                   Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened
                   his throat. Bronn managed to keep
                   Shagga from chopping off the dead man's
                   cock, which was fortunate, but even
                   still, Ulf is demanding blood money,
                   which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

                   When soldiers lack discipline, the fault
                   lies with their commander.
                            TYRION
                   Surely there are ways to have me killed
                   that would be less detrimental to the
                   war effort!
                            TYWIN
                   There will be no more discussion on the
                   matter.
                            TYRION
                   It appears I'm not hungry after all.
                   Excuse me, my lords.
           TYRION ANGRILY SETS THE GOBLET DOWN ON THE TABLE AND
           EXITS THE TENT WHILE TYWIN WATCHES ON.

               INT. TYRION'S TENT - EVENING
               A DARK HARD WOMAN, SHAE, TURNS TO SEE TYRION ENTER THE
               TENT.
                                    TYRION
                        Where did you find one so pretty at this
                        hour?
                                    BRONN
                        I took her.
                                    TYRION
                        Took her? From whom?
                                    BRONN
                        From ah, ser, what's his name? I donâ€™t
                        know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
                                    TYRION
                        And he didnâ€™t have anything to say about
                        it?
                                    BRONN
                        He said something.
                                    TYRION
                        Well, the odds of me living long enough
                        for him to retaliate have just dropped
                        drastically.  We'll be at the vanguard
                        tomorrow.
                                    BRONN
                        Oh well. I, ah, I think I'll go and
                        find myself one.
               BRONN EXITS THE TENT AND LEAVES TYRION ALONE WITH SHAE.
                                    TYRION

                   Shae. What did your mother call you?
                            TYRION
                   My mother died giving birth to me.
                            SHAE
                   Is that why I'm here? So we can talk
                   about our mothers?
                            TYRION
                   What sort of accent is that?
                            SHAE
                   Foreign.
                            TYRION

                            SHAE
                   What do you want from me?
                            TYRION
                   What do I want from you? I want you to
                   share my tent. I want you to pour my
                   wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs
                   when they are sore after a day's ride.
                   I want you to take no other man to bed
                   for as long as we're together and I want
                   you to fuck me like it's my last night
                   in this world. Which it may well be.
                            SHAE
                   And what do I get?
                            TYRION
                   One: safety.No one will hurt you for
                   as long as you're mine. Two: the
                   pleasure of my company, which I have
                   heard is spectacular.
                            SHAE
                   Who told you this? A woman you paid?
                            TYRION
                   And three: more gold than you could
                   spend if you lived a thousand years. Do
                   you accept my proposal?

               JORAH STEPS INTO THE TENT.

                        He's very strong. No one understands
                        how strong he is.
               JORAH PULLS OUT A DAGGER, KNEELS BESIDE DROGO, AND BEGINS
               TO SCRAPE LEAVES FROM DROGO'S CHEST.

                         blood. Here they only honor strength.
                         They'll be fighting after Drogo dies.
                         Whoever wins that fight will the new
                         Khal. He won't want any rivals. Your
                         boy will be plucked from your breast and
                         given to the dogs.

                   She was a wheelwright's orphan and she
                   was hungry. Together, we finished off
                   three chickens and a flagon of wine.
                   Impossible as it seems, there was a time
                   when I wasnâ€™t accustomed to wine. I
                   forgot how afraid I was around girls,
                   how I was always waiting for them to
                   laugh at me or look away embarrassed or
                   ask me about my tall, handsome brother.
                   I forgot about everything, but Tysha,

                   Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword, but
                   I seem to have lost it.
                            CATELYN
                   It is not your sword I want. Give me my
                   daughters back. Give me my husband.

                   You saw him.
                            ROBB
                   He's more use to us alive than dead.
                            CATELYN
                   Take him away and put him in irons.

                   We could end this war right now, boy.
                   Save thousands of lives. You fight for
                   the Starks. I fight for the Lannisters.

                   your weapons and let's end this here and

                   win. We're not doing it your way.

                        One victory does not make us conquerors.
                        Did we free my father? Did we rescue my
