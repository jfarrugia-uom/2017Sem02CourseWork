           EXT. WINTERFELL – COURTYARD - DAY. 
            
           A person dumps a crate of dead ravens on the 
           ground right at the feet of Dagmer.  He looks at 
           the dead birds.  Theon approaches and is staring 
           at the birds as well.

                          GUARDSMAN 2 
                   Open the gate!  
           Theon turns towards the gates.  Two Guardsmen 
           open the gates.  Theon walks to the center of the 
           courtyard waiting for the visitors.  Ironborn 
           ride on horses past Theon.  Yara rides in the 
           middle of the Ironborn.  She circles him on her 
           horse as Theon watches her and then continues 
           past him along with dozens more Ironborn. Theon 
           is shocked.   
                    
           INT. WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL – DAY. 
            
           Yara sits in the Lord’s seat at the high table 
           with the dozen Ironborn.  They are eating and 
           drinking.  Theon enters the room and approaches 
           the table.      
                          YARA 
                   Why it’s the Prince of Winterfell!

                   You should be proud of your brother’s 
                   achievement.  I took the great castle 
                   of Winterfell with twenty men.   
                          YARA 
                   You’re a great warrior.  I saw the 
                   bodies above your gates.  Which one 
                   gave you the tougher fight?  The 
                   cripple or the six year old?

           Yara’s men laugh at Theon.  He approaches her in 
           anger.     
                          THEON 
                   I treated the Stark boys with honor and 
                   they repaid me with treachery.   
                          YARA 
                   You treated them with honor?  By 
                   butchering them.  
                          THEON 
                   Before I had to kill them, I treated 
                   them with ... 
                          YARA 
                   You seized their home as is your right.  
                   We’re Ironborn, we take what we need.   
                          THEON 
                   Exactly.     
                           
                          YARA 
                   And you made them prisoners in their 
                   home and they ran away.  Is that 
                   treachery?  I’d call it bravery.

                          YARA 
                   A cunt.  A dumb cunt who killed the 
                   only two Starks in Winterfell? You know 
                   how valuable those boys were?    
                          THEON 
                   If I hadn’t killed them, the 
                   Northerners would think me weak.   
                          YARA 
                   You are weak.  And you’re stupid.

                   I’m warning you.

                   Go on, then.  Warn me.  
                    
           All the Ironborn stop and turn to Theon and Yara

                   You haven’t brought enough men.  How am 
                   I supposed to defend Winterfell with 
                   just this lot?

                   You’re not.  I’ve come to bring you 
                   home.  Father wants a word. 
                          THEON 
                   Is this a joke?  Winterfell is the

                   Aye it is.  Hundreds of miles from the   
                   sea.  We’re Islanders, baby brother.  
                   Had you forgotten that?  Our power 
                   comes from our ships.  And now that 
                   you’ve decorated your walls with the

                   He won’t find out.  We’ve killed all 
                   the ravens.  We have all the horses.  
                   I’ve taken Winterfell.  And I will keep

                   Children do not always think that about 
                   their fathers.  Believe me.     
                          ROBB 
                   He once told me that being a lord is 
                   like being a father.  Except you have 
                   thousands of children and you worry 
                   about all of them.  Farmers plowing the 
                   fields are yours to protect.  The 
                   charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours 
                   to protect.  The soldiers you order in 
                   to battle.  He told me he woke with 
                   fear in the morning and went to bed 
                   with fear in the night. I didn’t 
                   believe him.  I asked him how can a man 
                   be brave if he’s afraid?  That is the 
                   only time a man can be brave, he told 
                   me.

                   I wish I could have met him.

                   their gold and their glory than the 
                   charwomen scrubbing their floors.   
                          ROBB 
                   He didn’t care much about gold or

               A riderless horse gallops through the woods.  Brienne pulls 
               Jaime off his horse and he falls onto the ground.  She 
               slaps the horse’s hip and it takes off running. Jaime sits 
               up.   
                                  
                        Damn.    JAIME 
                         
               Brienne walks over and pulls off Jaime’s hood.  
               He turns and looks at her.

                        your name?   
                         
               Brienne pulls Jaime to his feet.   
                    
                                 JAIME 
                        I’m Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock.

           Brienne shoves Jaime to the ground still not 
           saying a word.   
                           
                          JAIME 
                   I didn’t mean to give offense, my lady.  
                   Forgive me.   
                    
                          BRIENNE  
                   Your crimes are past forgiveness, 
                   Kingslayer.   
                          JAIME  
                   Why do you hate me so much?  Have I 
                   ever harmed you?   
                    
           There is a horse drawn wagon crossing the bridge 
           that Jaime and Brienne see.   
                          BRIENNE 
                   You’ve harmed others.  Those you sworn 
                   to protect.  The weak, the innocent ...  
                          JAIME 
                   Has anyone ever told you you’re as

                   I’ve never seen you fight.       
                          JAIME 
                   The answer is no.  There are three men 
                   in the Kingdoms who might have a chance 
                   against me.  You’re not one of them.     
                    
           Brienne sets the boat up for them to get in it.   
                          BRIENNE 
                   All my life men like you have sneered 
                   at me.  And all my life I’ve been 
                   knocking men like you into the dust.   
                          JAIME

           Jaime gets in the boat while Brienne holds it.   
                          JAIME 
                   [SIGH]  I took you for a fighter.  A

           Brienne gets in the boat.   
                          JAIME 
                   Was I wrong?  You’re afraid.

                   Kingslayer.   
                    
           Brienne pulls out the ore and shoves the boat off 
           the bank and begins to paddle down the river.

           Arya is pouring water in glasses.    
                          KEVAN LANNISTER 
                   It’s not too late for King Joffrey and 
                   Cersei and the court to ride west to 
                   safety.       
                    
           Tywin turns to Kevan Lannister. 
                          TYWIN 
                   Surrender the Iron Throne?       
                          KEVAN LANNISTER 
                   Better than seeing their heads mounted 
                   on the city gates. 
                    
           Kevan Lannister is sitting at a table with 
           several generals and Tywin.   
                    
                          KEVAN LANNISTER 
                   Stannis will execute them all.     
                    
                          TYWIN 
                   No.  A king who runs who will not be 
                   king for long.   
                    
           Tywin leans forward and slams something on the 
           table.  Arya is pouring water in the glasses and 
           listening to the men talk.   
                    
                          TYWIN 
                   He’s a Lannister.  He’ll stand and 
                   fight.      
                    
           Kevan Lannister looks at Tywin in disagreement.

                   Ha!  The last time the scouts assured 
                   us of Stark’s movement he lured us into 
                   a trap.     
                    
           Arya turns and brings over a pitcher of water to 
           the men and fills their glasses.

                   Which is why my son is his prisoner.   
                    
           Arya pours water in a glass and steals a look at

           men’s glasses as the men continue their 
           discussion.

                   He’s sent a splinter force to recapture 
                   Winterfell.  [SIGH] The Greyjoys have

                   He’s a boy and he’s never lost a 
                   battle.   
                    
           Tywin is standing near the fire.   
                          TYWIN 
                   He’ll risk anything at any time because

           Rorge, Biter and some Lannister guards are 
           sitting at a table drinking.   
                
                          RORGE 
                   Look it.  Yoren’s little cunt.   
                    
           Arya sees them and walks over to the table.

           Rorge gets up and moves towards her. 
                
                          RORGE 
                   Where’s your stick now bitch?  I 
                   promised to fuck you with it.

             and Gendry are sitting by a fire.  Gendry is working   
             on some iron and Hot Pie is talking about food.   
                              HOT PIE 
                     You need sour cherries to make it 
                     right.  And the secret is, you dry the 
                     stones and then you break ‘em with a 
                     mallet.  That’s where the real flavor 
                     is.   
                      
             Gendry drips the hook in a bucket of water.   
                              HOT PIE 
                     You crush ‘em up real fine and then 
                     when you’re finished, sprinkle ‘em over 
                     the pie crust.   
                      
             Arya finds Gendry and Hot Pie.

                     Where is Jaqen?   
                              GENDRY 
                     How would I know?

                     I need him now.  Lord Tywin’s marching 
                     tonight.

                              GENDRY 
                     You need him?   
                              ARYA 
                     He’s helping me.

             Hot Pie takes another bite and doesn’t answer 
             Arya.  Arya walks over to him and grabs his face.

                        They were riding out the gates a few 
                        hours ago.  On patrol.  Let go of my 
                        ears.      
               Arya lets go of Hot Pie.  She turns as they hear a 
               commotion.  She sees Tywin and his generals mounting their 
               horses.

                        What do you want with him anyway?   
               Arya heads towards them to watch them leave.  She 
               watches as they leave the gates and are followed

                   You should start wearing the gold

                   I don’t wanna wear a gold cloak.

                          BRONN 
                   A cloak slows you down in a fight.  
                   Makes it hard to move quietly.  And the 
                   gold catches the light, so you’re nice 
                   and easy to spot at night.

                   Well you’re not sneaking through alley 
                   ways any longer.  You’re supposed to 
                   stand out. 
                          BRONN 
                   We had a deal.  And wearing a gold 
                   cloak wasn’t part of it.

           Tyrion goes back to his books.  Bronn stares at 
           him and taps his fingers on a book.  Tyrion looks

                   I’d swap all your books for a few good 
                   archers.   
           Bronn tosses a book on the table.  Varys enters 
           the room.

                   Commander.  I must compliment you on 
                   the gold cloak’s performance these last 
                   few weeks.   
                    
           Varys sits down next to Tyrion who is still 
           reading his book.  Bronn is pacing in the room.

                   Did you know there has been a marked

           Tyrion looks at Varys.  He closes his book and then 
           looks over at Bronn.  
                          TYRION 
                   I did not know.  And how did you 
                   accomplish this marked drop in

                          BRONN 
                   Me and the lads rounded up all the

                   Aye, we talked about it.  Have you ever 
                   been in a city under siege?    
                    
            Tyrion doesn’t respond and just looks down.

                   Maybe this part’s not in your books.   
                    
           Bronn starts to pace around the room.   
                    
                          BRONN 
                   See, it’s not the fighting that kills 
                   most people.  It’s the starving.  
                   Food’s worth more than gold.  Noble 
                   ladies sell their diamonds for a sack 
                   of potatoes.       
                    
           Bronn sits down at the table across from Varys and Tyrion.

                   Things get bad enough, the poor start 
                   eating each other. The thieves, they 
                   love a siege.  Soon as the gates are 
                   sealed, they steal all the food.  By

           nails.

                   Tywin Lannister was right here.  And

                   A girl owes one more name.  The Red God 
                   demands it.  Give me the man a name.   
                          ARYA 
                   How long after I give you then name 
                   does it take you to kill someone?      
                          JAQEN 
                   A minute.  An hour.     
                      
           Jaqen turns and begins to walk over and place his 
           helmet down.   
                          JAQEN 
                   A month.  Death is certain.  The time 
                   is not.   
                    
           Jaqen sits down.

                   He’s taking his army to attack my

                   This a man cannot do.

                   You promised you’d help me.

               INT. – KING’S LANDING – CERSEI’S CHAMBER - NIGHT.  
                 
               Tyrion is sitting at the table eating dinner.  
               Podrick pours Tyrion some wine in his glass.   
                
                                  TYRION 
                        Thank you Podrick.   
               Cersei is standing on the other side.  Podrick makes eye 
               contact with Cersei and then bows and leaves the room.

                        You and Varys both.   
               Tyrion glares at Cersei for her smart comment and ignores 
               it.   
                                  TYRION 
                        Excellent lamprey pie.  Were you 
                        slaving away in the kitchen all day?   
               Cersei ignores him and stares off in the

                   Better than you.  Some men have a gift 
                   for this sort of thing.  Some don’t.  
                   His place is not on the battlefield.

                   It’s not on the throne, either.  Sadly 
                   for all of us.

                   No. I’d say you possess above average 
                   intelligence.         
                          CERSEI

                   Varys isn’t the only one who hears 
                   whispers.  Really?   A Lannister lion 
                   necklace.  You need to hide your secret 
                   whores more carefully.   
                          TYRION 
                   You’ve forgotten the most important 
                   thing about whores.        
                          CERSEI 
                   Oh?  Well, you’re the expert.  Tell me.   
                          TYRION 
                   You don’t buy them.  You only rent 
                   them.

                   You’re usually a better liar, baby 
                   brother.  This one you like.  You like 
                   her very much.  Could it be love?  
                   Don’t worry, she’ll be treated gently 
                   enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt and then 
                   every wound he suffers she’ll suffer 
                   too.  And if he dies, there isn’t a man 
                   alive who could devise a more painful 
                   death for your little cunt.   
                          TYRION 
                   And how do I know you haven’t killed

           Tyrion turns and watches Mandon walk to the door.  
           A moment later the Kingsguard escorts Ros in the 
           room.  She has been assaulted and her clothes are 
           visibly torn.  Tyrion keeps a straight face but 
           stares at Ros.  Tyrion gets up and walks over to 
           her.

                         When I was twelve my mother and father                
                         went to a wedding.  Weddings in 
                         Volantis last for days, you know.  And 
                         they left me with my little brother.  
                         The second afternoon they were gone was 
                         the hottest day in the three year 
                         summer.  We couldn’t bear to be inside, 
                         so we ran down to the Rhoyne.   
                          
               Talisa walks to the end of the table.

                         Every child in Volantis was in the 
                         Rhoyne that day.   
                          
               Robb walks to the end of the table where Talisa 
               is standing.   
                          
                                  TALISA 
                         The rich, the poor, we were all there 
                         naked, screaming, racing to the little 
                         islands. Drummers were playing for 
                         coppers in the east bank.   
               Talisa takes a drink of water.  Robb and Talisa 
               sit down at the table.

                         I was treading water, talking to a 
                         friend when I realized I hadn’t seen my 
                         brother.  I called his name.  And then 
                         I started screaming his name.  And then 
                         I saw him, floating face down. And my 
                         heart just ... stopped.  I was ... 
                         [SIGH] I dragged him from the water.  
                         My friend helped me I think.  I don’t 
                         even remember.  He was so little.  And 
                         we pulled him onto the riverbank.  And 
                         I screamed at him.  And I shook him and 
                         he was dead.  Just dead.

                          TALISA 
                   A man ran over.  He had a fish tattoo 
                   on his face.  In Volantis the slaves 
                   have tattoos so you know what they are 
                   without having to talk to them.  And 
                   this man worked on a fishing boat.  And 
                   he pushed me out of the way.  You have 
                   to understand for a slave to push a 
                   high born girl, that’s death for the 
                   man.  A terrible death.  But he pushed 
                   me out of the way.  And he started 
                   pressing on my brother’s chest. Again, 
                   and again, and again until my brother 
                   spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried 
                   out and the man cradled his head and 
                   told him to be calm.  I decided two 
                   things that day.  I would not waste my 
                   years planning dances and masquerades 
                   with the other noble ladies.  And when 
                   I came of age, I would never live in a 
                   slave city again.

           Robb is mesmerized by Talisa.  She looks up and

                   needed that bridge.

                   I hope it’s a very beautiful bridge.     
                    
           Robb lunges at Talisa and they kiss passionately.

                   No?  Robert did.  He gave Storm’s End

                   riding anywhere.  Not with the castle 
                   surrounded.  [SNIFF] We couldn’t feed 
                   them, so fine, no horses.  Then the 
                   cats.  Never liked cats.  So fine.  I 
                   do like dogs.  Good animals, loyal, but 
                   we ate them.  Then the rats.  The night 
                   before you slipped through, I thought 
                   my wife was dying.  She couldn’t speak 
                   anymore she was so frail.  And then you 
                   made it through the lines.  Slipped

                   it to Renly, so I gave it up.  Insult 
                   or no, I gave it up.  Because Robert 
                   was my older brother and he was the

                          JORAH 
                   They’re not your children. I know they 
                   call you the mother of dragons, and I 
                   know you love them, but you didn’t grow 
                   them in your womb.  They didn’t suckle 
                   at your breast.  They are dragons, 
                   khaleesi.  And if we stay in Qarth, 
                   we’ll die.

                   That’s what the warlock wants.  He told 
                   you so himself.  If you enter that 
                   place, you will never leave again.  His

                   And what of my magic?  You saw me step

                   burn.  What did the flames do to me?

                   As you say.  But it don’t hurt to let 
                   ‘em rot a while longer.   
                    
           Theon reaches down and picks up a leather pouch 
           and shows it to Dagmer.

           Dagmer is confused.  Luwin walks across the 
           courtyard but stops cause and sees something.   
                          DAGMER 
                   He’s feeding the crops now.

           eye contact and then she disappears.

                   His wife too.     
                    
           Luwin turns back to see Dagmer and Theon.

                   You wanna keep a man silent, you 
                   silence him.     
           Luwin turns back and starts walking across the 
           courtyard again toward the burned bodies of Bran 
           and Rickon.
