                      ALICE (CONT’D) 
                     Like a baby snail

                         SAM 
                      And little Sam. 
       01:06:25:05         
                      SAM (CONT’D) 
                       As if I cut 
                    their throats myself. 
       01:06:28:08         
                         PYP  
                     Maybe she managed 
                     to hide herself. 
       01:06:29:19         
                     PYP (CONT’D - OS) 
                 I thought all of you was dead. 
       01:06:31:15         
                     PYP (CONT’D - OS) 
                  You went north with Mormont 
                    and no one came back. 
       01:06:33:22         
                      PYP (CONT’D) 
                      Not for ages. 
       01:06:35:27         
                      PYP (CONT’D) 
                     But then you did.

                    DOLOROUS EDD (CONT’D) 
                    and he was the worst  
                    shit I've ever met. 
       01:06:43:19         
                    DOLOROUS EDD (CONT’D) 
                  She survived the long march 
                      to the Wall. 
       01:06:45:18         
                  DOLOROUS EDD (CONT’D - OS) 
                  She survived a white walker, 
                     for fuck's sake. 
       01:06:50:15  DOLOROUS EDD (CONT’D) 
                   She might have got out. 
       01:06:54:12  
             Sam looks around at the other men. 
                         SAM 
                      She might have. 
       01:06:57:29         
                         JON 
                   If they hit Mole's Town, 
       01:07:00:16    JON (CONT’D) 
                     then we're next. 
       01:07:05:15    JON (CONT’D) 
                Mance and his army must be close. 
       01:07:07:20         
                       Grenn (OS) 
                     100,000 of them. 
       01:07:09:06    Grenn (CONT’D) 
                     And there's what, 
                      105 of us left? 
       01:07:11:23    DOLOROUS EDD 
                   You counting Black Jack, 
                     Kegs, and Mully? 
       01:07:16:10  DOLOROUS EDD (CONT’D) 
       01:07:17:20       102. 
                         PYP 
                      How do 102 men 
                      stop 100,000? 
       01:07:24:19  
             Dolorous Edd walks around to the head of the table and 
             pours a drink. 
                      DOLOROUS EDD 
                     Whoever dies last, 
                      be a good lad 
       01:07:27:13  DOLOROUS EDD (CONT’D - OS) 
                   and burn the rest of us. 
       01:07:29:23         
                  DOLOROUS EDD (CONT’D - OS) 
                      Once I'm done 
                     with this world, 
       01:07:32:17         
                    DOLOROUS EDD (CONT’D) 
                      I don't want  
                      to come back. 
             Dolorous Edd takes a drink. The other men take a drink 
             except for Jon.

             EXT. MEEREENESE STREAM – DAY 
              
             Grey Worm is swimming and bathing with the other 
             Unsullied. 
              
             Grey Worm stops to look at Missandei as she washes her 
             clothes naked.  Grey Worm continues to watch her. 
             Missandei sees Grey Worm watching her and stands.  
             Grey Worm continues watching with an embarrassed look.  
             Missandei covers herself. Grey Worm goes under water 
             and swims away. 
                      DAENERYS (OS) 
                     You think he was 
                      spying on you?

             INT. BED CHAMBER – DAY 
                      MISSANDEI (OS) 
                      No, not spying. 
       01:08:39:18    DAENERYS (OS) 
                     The Dothraki think 
                   outsiders are ridiculous 
       01:08:41:21         
                   DAENERYS (CONT’D - OS) 
                      taking shame  
                     in the naked body. 
       01:08:43:07         
             Daenerys stands doing Missandei’s hair as she sits. 
                     DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                    They make love under 
                   the stars for the whole 
                     khalasar to see. 
       01:08:48:01     MISSANDEI 
                     Yes, Your Grace. 
       01:08:50:08         
                        DAENERYS 
                      But you are not  
                       Dothraki. 
       01:08:52:18     MISSANDEI 
                         No. 
              
       01:08:56:02      DAENERYS 
                     Well, I don't see 
                      why it matters. 
       01:08:57:26         
                     DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                       Grey Worm 
                     isn't interested. 
       01:08:59:09         
                     DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                  None of the Unsullied care 
                   what's under our clothes. 
       01:09:04:25     MISSANDEI 
                     He was interested. 
       01:09:07:05         
             Daenerys pauses in braiding Missandei’s hair.  
                        DAENERYS 
                         What? 
       01:09:11:02     MISSANDEI 
                  I believe he was interested. 
       01:09:15:28 
             Daenerys looks confused. 
                        DANERYS 
                     When the slavers 
                     castrate the boys, 
       01:09:18:03         
                     DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                   do they take all of it? 
       01:09:19:27         
                       MISSANDEI 
                       All of it? 
       01:09:21:29      DANERYS 
                         The— 
       01:09:24:01         
                     DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                  the pillar and the stones. 
       01:09:26:18         
                       MISSANDEI 
                      I don't know, 
                       Your Grace. 
       01:09:31:17         
                        DANERYS 
                       Haven't you 
                      ever wondered? 
       01:09:37:14     MISSANDEI 
                     Yes, Your Grace. 
                           
       01:09:57:15  
             INT. MEEREENESE CASTLE – DAY 
             Missandei is alone ascending the stairs slowly.  
                      GREY WORM (OS) 
                        Missandei. 
                           
             Missandei turns to see Grey Worm behind her at the 
             foot of the stairs. 
              
       01:10:02:11     GREY WORM

                  Do ima jini va aol ovulegho.

                  You don't need to apologize.

                         Do. 
                           
                       (Subtitled) 
                         No. 
       01:10:15:08     GREY WORM 
                   The lessons you give I  
                    in common tongue... 
       01:10:20:16   GREY WORM (CONT’D) 
                   these are precious to I. 
       01:10:22:24         
                       MISSANDEI 
                        To me. 
                           
                       GREY WORM 
                        To me. 
       01:10:25:00     MISSANDEI 
                   I don't remember teaching  
                   you the word precious. 
       01:10:28:05         
                       GREY WORM 
                     Jorah the Andal, 
                      he teaches I— 
                           
                           
       01:10:31:05   GREY WORM (CONT’D) 
                   he teaches me this word. 
       01:10:35:13     MISSANDEI 
                   Do you remember the name 
       01:10:37:25  you were given at birth? 
                       GREY WORM 
                    I remember nothing. 
       01:10:40:20         
                     GREY WORM (CONT’D) 
                      Only Unsullied. 
       01:10:42:16    MISSANDEI (OS) 
                     When they cut you, 
       01:10:44:18   MISSANDEI (CONT’D) 
                    do you remember that? 
             Grey Worms shakes his head. 
       01:10:49:06   MISSANDEI (CONT’D) 
                       I'm sorry. 
       01:10:51:14         
                     MISSANDEI (CONT’D) 
                     I'm sorry they did  
                      that to you. 
       01:10:53:23         
                       GREY WORM 
                         Why? 
                       Why sorry? 
       01:10:56:10         
                       MISSANDEI 
                    It's a terrible thing 
                      to do to a boy. 
        
        
       01:11:04:11  
              
             Grey Worm climbs a few stairs toward Missandei. 
                       GREY WORM 
                  If the masters never cut me, 
       01:11:06:25         
                     GREY WORM (CONT’D) 
                    I never am Unsullied. 
       01:11:08:26   GREY WORM (CONT’D) 
                     I never stand in

                     GREY WORM (CONT’D) 
                   when Daenerys Stormborn

                     I never am chosen 
                   to lead the Unsullied. 
       01:11:20:12         
                     GREY WORM (CONT’D) 
                   I never meet Missandei

                     GREY WORM (CONT’D) 
                   from the island of Naath. 
       01:11:41:14         
             Grey Worm looks up and makes eye contact with 
             Missandei. 
                   GREY WORM (CONT’D - OS) 
                      I am sorry I--

                       I am sorry. 
             Grey Worm looks down, turns away to go, and begins 
             descending the stairs.

             An army on horseback is gathered.

       01:12:35:02  
        
             Ramsay stands across from Theon and pats Theon’s 
             armor. 
                        RAMSAY 
                      Kraken. Mmm.

                      RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                      Strong as long 
                   as they're in the sea.

                      RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                     When you take them

                      RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                      and slump into 
                     a heap of nothing. 
       01:12:49:06         
                      RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                       You'd think 
                     they’d know that. 
       01:12:51:12         
                      RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                      Unfortunately, 
                   they're not very bright. 
       01:12:55:16    RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                   What do you tell them? 
                           
                           
       01:12:57:14       THEON 
                     I'm Theon Greyjoy,

                      son of Balon,

             Ramsay puts Theon’s glove on his hand for him. 
       01:13:02:22      RAMSAY 
                   And what are you really? 
                           
                         THEON

                      Are you sure? 
             Theon nods. 
       01:13:09:05    RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                    You do look very much 
                       like a lord. 
       01:13:11:22    RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                     Formidable, proud.

                       I'm Reek.

       01:13:19:16         
                         THEON 
                        Always.

                        RAMSAY 
                      That's right. 
       01:13:23:29         
             Ramsay places his hand on Theon’s cheek. 
                      RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                    Until you're rotting 
                      in the ground. 
       01:13:30:03  
        
             Ramsay puts his arm around Theon’s shoulder and they 
             turn to walk together. 
                      RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                    Remember what you are 
                    and what you're not. 
       01:13:33:29    RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                    Bring me Moat Cailin. 
             Ramsay and Theon overlook Moat Cailin. 
       01:13:45:08  
             (cawing)  
             Theon rides alone carrying a raised flag. 
       01:14:06:13       GUARD 
                       No closer. 
             Theon stops at the gates of Moat Cailin and looks on 
             at the guard upon the watchtower. 
       01:14:10:28       GUARD 
                      Who are you? 
                           
             Theon is escorted into the gates of Moat Cailin on 
             horseback.

       01:14:34:21  
             (flies buzzing)  
             Theon is escorted on foot to Kenning. Kenning is being 
             helped to his feet by another man. 
       01:14:51:11  
             Theon approaches Kenning. 
                        KENNING 
                      I'm Kenning, 
       01:14:53:21         
                     KENNING (CONT’D) 
                  commander of this garrison. 
       01:14:57:25   KENNING (CONT’D) 
                And you say you're Theon Greyjoy? 
       01:14:59:25         
                         THEON 
                         Yes. 
                           
             Theon moves closer to Kenning. 
       01:15:01:27      KENNING 
                 And why should I believe that? 
       01:15:05:00         
                         THEON 
                     I was born on Pyke 
                     to Balon Greyjoy. 
                           
       01:15:08:01    THEON (CONT’D) 
                       His third 
                    and last living son. 
       01:15:10:21         
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                     I am your prince. 
       01:15:12:14         
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                       I swear it 
                     by the Drowned God. 
       01:15:14:18         
             Theon places his closed hand over his heart. 
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                      What is dead 
                      may never die.

                      What is dead

       01:15:19:00         
                        KENNING 
                      And if you were 
                       my prince, 
       01:15:21:13         
                     KENNING (CONT’D) 
                    why are you marching 
                    with a Bolton army? 
       01:15:23:23         
                         THEON 
                    Lord Bolton took me 
                   captive after Winterfell. 
       01:15:26:14         
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                    He sent me to treat 
                   with you in good faith 
                           
       01:15:29:12    THEON (CONT’D) 
                   as your fellow ironborn. 
       01:15:30:25         
                        KENNING 
                      And what does 
                     Lord Bolton want? 
       01:15:35:15         
             Theon hands Kenning a paper. 
                         THEON 
                      You are fading 
                      from sickness, 
       01:15:37:22         
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                  you are badly outnumbered, 
                           
             Kenning unrolls the piece of paper. 
       01:15:39:08    THEON (CONT’D) 
                    and you're hundreds  
                   of miles from the sea. 
       01:15:41:16         
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                   Lord Bolton implores you  
                    to protect your men 
       01:15:43:17    THEON (CONT’D) 
                   and abandon this fortress  
                   you can no longer hold. 
       01:15:47:04         
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                   Do this, and he will be 
                   just and fair with you 
       01:15:50:13         
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                   as he has been with me. 
       01:15:54:12    THEON (CONT’D) 
                    The Boltons will give 
                    you safe passage to 
                     the Stony Shore. 
       01:15:57:14         
                        KENNING 
                       He wants us 
                       to surrender? 
       01:15:59:22         
                         THEON 
                      My own father, 
                       your king, 
       01:16:02:17         
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                    surrendered years ago 
                    to Robert Baratheon. 
       01:16:05:26         
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                      I watched him 
                      bend the knee. 
       01:16:08:04         
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                   There was no shame there. 
       01:16:09:24         
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                    He fought with honor, 
       01:16:13:14     as did you. 
             Kenning collapses. 
             (groans)  
              
       01:16:16:18  
             Kenning is helped to his feet by the men at his side. 
             (mutters)  
              
              
                        KENNING 
                       "No shame." 
                    "Fought with honor." 
       01:16:18:26         
                         THEON 
                       I'm sorry, 
                      I didn't hear. 
       01:16:23:00  
             Kenning spits on Theon. 
                        KENNING 
                       "No shame." 
                    "Fought with honor." 
                           
             Kenning spits on the ground. 
       01:16:28:29   KENNING (CONT’D) 
                     Only a whipped dog 
                    would speak this way. 
       01:16:34:05   KENNING (CONT’D) 
                       Or a woman. 
       01:16:36:28   KENNING (CONT’D) 
                    Are you a woman, boy? 
       01:16:38:26         
             Theon starts shaking. 
                       THEON  
                      You don't know— 
       01:16:40:09         
                        KENNING 
                      The ironborn 
                    will not surrender. 
       01:16:42:23         
             (mumbling)    
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                         Reek. 
                     My name is Reek... 
       01:16:44:14         
                        KENNING 
                       You go tell 
                     your master that, 
       01:16:46:22         
                     KENNING (CONT’D) 
                      Theon Greyjoy, 
       01:16:49:00         
                     KENNING (CONT’D) 
                      or whoever the 
                      fuck you are. 
       01:16:51:02         
             (quietly)   THEON 
                     My name is Reek. 
       01:16:52:26         
                        KENNING 
                     What in the hell 
                     are you muttering? 
       01:16:54:12         
                         THEON 
                       I'm Reek. 
             The man behind Kenning puts an axe through Kenning’s 
             skull. 
       01:16:57:19    THEON (CONT’D) 
                         Reek. 
             Kenning falls down dead. 
       01:17:06:06  
             Lieutenant picks up the piece of paper. 
                       LIEUTENANT 
                    If we yield, we live? 
       01:17:08:03     LIEUTENANT 
                    Is that what it says 
                    on this paper here? 
       01:17:10:02         
                         THEON 
                     Yes. Have your men 
                    raise the white flag 
                    and open the gates. 
       01:17:14:09         
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                     You're going home. 
       01:17:23:23  
              
             The Lieutenant’s body is held up by spears, flayed, 
             bloody, and dead. 
                       RAMSAY (OS) 
                   You didn't really think 
                   I'd let them go, did you? 
       01:17:26:02         
        
             Ramsay stands with his arm around Theon’s shoulders as 
             they look on at the Lieutenant’s body. 
                      RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                      It's fallen out 
                    of fashion, flaying. 
       01:17:29:23         
                      RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                      Sad, but true. 
       01:17:32:02         
             Ramsay points at Theon. 
                      RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                   Traditions are important. 
                           
                           
                           
                           
       01:17:34:04    RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                      Where are we 
                    without our history? 
       01:17:36:14         
                        RAMSAY 
                         Eh? 
                           
                         THEON 
                      Yes, my lord. 
       01:17:38:27         
                      THEON (CONT’D) 
                    Will we go home now? 
       01:17:42:24      RAMSAY 
                     I believe we will. 
       01:17:44:16         
                      RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                     To our new home. 
             Ramsay pats Theon on his chest and walks away. 
       01:17:56:27  
             INT. THE EYRIE – DAY 
                       ROYCE (OS) 
                   You have foreign blood, 
                    don't you, Baelish? 
       01:17:59:24         
                      LITTLEFINGER 
                    A great-grandfather 
                     from Braavos, yes. 
       01:18:03:13         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                       I suppose 
                    all of our ancestors 
       01:18:06:00         
                   LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D)  
                    came from somewhere 
                     else originally. 
       01:18:08:04         
                       ROYCE (OS) 
                      Our forebearers 
                     settled the Vale 
       01:18:10:07         
                    ROYCE (CONT’D - OS) 
                   thousands of years ago. 
       01:18:11:24         
                    ROYCE (CONT’D - OS) 
                   We've fought off invaders 
                       ever since. 
       01:18:14:02         
                      LITTLEFINGER 
                   The beauty of the Vale 
                      is matched only 
       01:18:15:22         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                      by the nobility 
                   of its great families. 
       01:18:18:04         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   Lady Arryn often told me 
       01:18:20:09         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   that you were her rock, 
                       Lord Royce. 
       01:18:22:29         
             A council is sitting facing Littlefinger as he sits 
             across from them. 
                         ROYCE 
                    She told me nothing 
                    about you, Baelish. 
       01:18:25:24         
                      ROYCE (CONT’D) 
                     But I didn't need 
                     to hear from her. 
       01:18:28:11         
                      ROYCE (CONT’D) 
                      Moneylender.  
                      Whoremonger. 
       01:18:30:14         
                      ROYCE (CONT’D) 
                   You've been licking Tywin 
                  Lannister's boots so long, 
       01:18:33:25         
                      ROYCE (CONT’D) 
                      it's a wonder 
                   your tongue's not black. 
                           
                      LITTLEFINGER 
                        My lord-- 
       01:18:35:21       ROYCE 
                     And when Jon Arryn  
                   named you Master of Coin, 
                      no one cared. 
       01:18:39:14         
                      ROYCE (CONT’D) 
                   Always been a grubby job. 
       01:18:41:15         
                      ROYCE (CONT’D) 
                       Why not let 
                    a grubby man do it? 
       01:18:43:24         
                    ROYCE (CONT’D - OS) 
                     But when I heard 
                   you were lurking here, 
       01:18:46:10         
                      ROYCE (CONT’D) 
                      fawning over 
                      the Lady Arryn— 
       01:18:48:06         
                     LITTLEFINGER (OS) 
                   Lady Arryn invited me. 
       01:18:50:05         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    She and I have been 
                   close since childhood. 
       01:18:52:27         
                         ANYA 
                     Yes, we all know 
                    how close you were. 
       01:18:55:15         
                     ANYA (CONT’D - OS) 
                  Lady Arryn's predilections 
                    were her own affair. 
       01:18:58:13         
                      ANYA (CONT’D) 
                   Her death is our affair. 
       01:19:00:10         
                      LITTLEFINGER 
                       Of course. 
                       Her suicide 
                     shattered us all. 
       01:19:02:29         
                         ANYA 
                    She was an odd fish. 
       01:19:05:09    ANYA (CONT’D) 
                    Everyone knew that. 
                      But suicide? 
       01:19:08:07   ANYA (CONT’D - OS) 
                       She adored 
                     that boy of hers. 
       01:19:11:16         
                      ANYA (CONT’D) 
                      I don't see her 
                      abandoning him. 
                      Not by choice. 
                           
                           
       01:19:14:05     ROYCE (OS) 
                   Strange that within days 
                     of your arrival, 
       01:19:17:08         
                      ROYCE (CONT’D) 
                   you've married Lady Arryn 
                   and she's fallen through 
                      the Moon Door. 
       01:19:21:18         
                      LITTLEFINGER 
                She was always prone to melancholy. 
       01:19:23:25         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    My lady wasn't meant 
                    for a world as brutal 
                        as ours. 
       01:19:27:11         
                         ROYCE 
                      We were told 
                    there was a witness. 
                        A girl. 
       01:19:29:12         
                         ANYA  
                     A niece of yours, 
                       I believe. 
       01:19:33:10         
             Littlefinger looks down and shakes his head. 
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   A girl with no learning 
                    and scattered wits. 
       01:19:36:06         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                      I assure you, 
                   she would be of no help. 
                           
                           
                           
       01:19:37:16       ROYCE 
                       We'd like 
                     to speak with her. 
       01:19:41:20    LITTLEFINGER 
                     Let me fetch her. 
                           
             Littlefinger starts to get up. 
                       ANYA (OS) 
                        No need. 
                           
             Littlefinger maintains his seat. 
       01:19:44:02    ANYA (CONT’D) 
                    We prefer to hear her 
                   testimony unadulterated. 
             The doors are opened and Sansa enters. 
       01:19:56:10  
             (door closes) 
                 
       01:19:58:03  
             Sansa walks toward Littlefinger then turns to the 
             council. 
                      ANYA (CONT’D) 
                    Come closer, child. 
       01:19:59:28    ANYA (CONT’D) 
                     You have nothing 
                   to fear from us or him. 
             Sansa approaches the council. Littlefinger continues 
             looking down. 
       01:20:03:12   ANYA (CONT’D - OS) 
                     Lord Baelish here 
                      is your uncle? 
             Sansa nods. 
       01:20:07:23  
                      ANYA (CONT’D) 
                    Your name is Alayne? 
              Sansa nods. 
       01:20:11:02   ANYA (CONT’D - OS) 
                   Perhaps you would feel 
                   more comfortable if Lord 
                   Baelish left the room. 
       01:20:14:05         
                      LITTLEFINGER 
                        My lady— 
                           
                         ANYA 
                    I wasn't asking you. 
       01:20:16:02         
                         SANSA 
                      He can stay. 
                           
                         ROYCE 
                  Speak up, girl, you're not 
                    a damn kitchen mouse. 
       01:20:19:04       ROYCE 
                    Tell us what you saw. 
       01:20:24:03 
             Sansa turns back to Littlefinger. 
                         SANSA 
                   I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. 
       01:20:26:17         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                   I have to tell the truth. 
        
        
        
       01:20:33:17  
             Sansa turns back to the council, her eyes shifted down 
             at the floor. 
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                      I'll tell you 
                       everything. 
       01:20:35:14         
                         ANYA 
                      Please, Alayne, 
                     leave nothing out. 
       01:20:41:18       SANSA 
                   My name is not Alayne. 
       01:20:44:02  
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                     It's Sansa Stark, 
       01:20:46:18    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                      eldest daughter 
                    of Lord Eddard Stark. 
       01:20:49:04         
             Sansa looks up at Royce. 
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                   Lord Royce, we met when 
                   you came to Winterfell. 
       01:20:52:01         
                    SANSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                  You were escorting your son 
                   Ser Waymar to the Wall. 
                           
             Royce looks at Sansa complexed. 
       01:20:54:24         
                         ROYCE 
                      Sansa Stark? 
                           
       01:20:58:05  
             Royce looks at Littlefinger. 
                      ROYCE (CONT’D) 
                      You tell lies 
                     right to my face, 
                     you little worm? 
       01:21:01:12         
                         SANSA 
                      Lord Baelish 
                    has told many lies. 
       01:21:06:28    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                     All to protect me. 
       01:21:10:15  SANSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                      Since my father 
                      was executed, 
       01:21:12:21         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                    I have been a hostage 
                     in King's Landing. 
       01:21:15:18         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                   A plaything for Joffrey 
                       to torture 
       01:21:18:12         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                      or Queen Cersei 
                       to torment. 
       01:21:20:18         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                      They beat me, 
                    they humiliated me, 
       01:21:23:09         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                      they married me 
                       to the Imp. 
       01:21:26:07         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                     I had no friends 
                    in King's Landing... 
       01:21:31:09    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                       except one. 
       01:21:38:17  
             Sansa turns back to look at Littlefinger 
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                      He saved me. 
             Littlefinger looks up at Sansa. 
       01:21:41:06    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                     Smuggled me away 
                   when he had the chance. 
       01:21:45:28  
             Sansa sits. 
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                    He knew I'd be safe 
                     here in the Eyrie 
       01:21:48:19         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                     with my own blood, 
                      my Aunt Lysa. 
       01:21:52:29    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                    The Lannisters have 
                    friends everywhere. 
       01:21:55:25         
                    SANSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                      Even the Vale. 
                           
                           
       01:21:57:07  
             The council looks on at Sansa. 
                    SANSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                     He made me swear 
                     not to tell anyone 
                      my true name. 
       01:22:00:14         
                         VANCE 
                    Your secret is safe 
                     with us, my lady. 
       01:22:03:06         
                       ROYCE (OS) 
                    Your father grew up 
                  right here in these halls. 
       01:22:05:28         
                      ROYCE (CONT’D) 
                     We hunted together 
                       many times. 
       01:22:08:02         
                      ROYCE (CONT’D) 
                     He was a fine man. 
       01:22:09:19         
                         ANYA 
                    Tell us what happened 
                    to your aunt, Sansa. 
       01:22:16:08       SANSA 
                     You knew her well, 
                     my lords, my lady. 
       01:22:19:11         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                     You knew she was 
                     a troubled woman. 
       01:22:21:22         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                     She always loved 
                      Lord Baelish. 
       01:22:24:14    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                    She told me herself. 
             Sansa looks back at Littlefinger. 
       01:22:26:07    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                  From the moment he arrived 
                   at the gates of Riverrun, 
       01:22:28:25    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                   a boy of eight carrying 
                    everything he owned 
                     in a little sack. 
       01:22:33:18  SANSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                    She confessed to me 
                  she never loved Lord Arryn. 
       01:22:37:28    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                      She did as her 
                     father commanded, 
                   as so many of us have. 
       01:22:41:14  SANSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                 When the gods finally allowed 
                  her to be with Lord Baelish, 
       01:22:45:18         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                     she was so happy. 
       01:22:47:09         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                       For a time. 
       01:22:49:26    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                        My aunt 
                    was a jealous lady. 
        
       01:22:54:10    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                     She was terrified 
                     that Lord Baelish 
       01:22:57:23         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                      didn't love her  
                        anymore. 
       01:22:59:00         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                    That he would abandon 
                   her for a younger woman. 
       01:23:05:01    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                       And then... 
       01:23:07:01         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                  one day she saw him kiss me. 
       01:23:10:14         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                       Lady Sansa. 
       01:23:12:01         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                  It was a peck on the cheek, 
                   Lord Royce, nothing more. 
       01:23:15:10         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                      Lord Baelish 
                     is my uncle now, 
                   in truth, by marriage. 
       01:23:18:29         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                     He's always been 
                      so kind to me. 
       01:23:21:24         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                  I was so happy to be here, 
                       to be free. 
       01:23:24:25    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                    All because of him. 
       01:23:27:01         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                       But my aunt  
                      turned on me. 
       01:23:29:11         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                      She cursed me. 
                     Called me a whore. 
       01:23:32:19         
             Sansa begins to cry. 
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                    Promised to throw me 
                   through the Moon Door. 
       01:23:35:09         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                   When Lord Baelish tried 
                      to calm her, 
       01:23:37:27         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                      she struck him. 
       01:23:39:23         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                   She said she didn't want 
                     to live anymore. 
       01:23:41:16         
                    SANSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                    She stood on the edge 
                     of that Moon Door. 
       01:23:43:20         
                    SANSA (CONT’D - OS) 
                        He tried 
                    to reason with her. 
                           
                           
       01:23:45:17    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                      Promised her 
                    she was the only one 
                     he had ever loved, 
       01:23:47:25         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                   but she stepped through 
                   those doors and she was-- 
             Sansa becomes overwhelmed and stands up, stifling 
             cries with her hand over her mouth. 
       01:23:54:29       ANYA 
                         Shh. 
       01:23:57:02         
             Anya stands and hugs Sansa. 
                         ANYA 
                   Shh, it's not your fault, 
                       sweet girl. 
       01:24:05:06    ANYA (CONT’D) 
                        It's not 
                       your fault. 
             Sansa calmly looks over Anya’s shoulder and makes eye 
             contact with Littlefinger. 
       01:24:23:20 
             Royce, Anya, and Littlefinger walk through a hallway 
             together. 
                         ROYCE 
                      You could see 
                     it in the way she 
                     raised that boy. 
                            
                           
                           
                           
                      ROYCE (CONT’D) 
                     Feeding him from 
                    her own teats when he 
                     was 10 years old. 
       01:24:29:03         
                         ANYA 
                       Lord Royce! 
                   This is hardly the time. 
       01:24:32:03         
                         ROYCE 
                    Apologies, my lady. 
       01:24:33:25         
                      ROYCE (CONT’D) 
                       And to you 
                     as well, Baelish. 
       01:24:35:24         
                      ROYCE (CONT’D) 
                      We treated you 
                      a bit harshly. 
       01:24:37:21         
                      LITTLEFINGER 
                     You want justice, 
                       Lord Royce. 
       01:24:39:13         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                      I can hardly 
                    complain about that. 
       01:24:41:00         
             Littlefinger extends his arm, gesturing to a balcony 
             overlooking the Moon Door. 
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                     I want the same. 
       01:24:42:21         
             Littlefinger, Anya, and Royce descend the stairs 
             toward the Moon Door. 
                         ANYA 
                  Not much justice to be meted 
                   out in suicide, is there? 
       01:24:47:11         
                      LITTLEFINGER 
                      For Lysa, no. 
                     But for her son? 
       01:24:49:27         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                     Only 20 years ago, 
                   the knights of the Vale 
       01:24:52:00         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   rode behind Jon Arryn, 
                  Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. 
       01:24:55:11         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    They fought together 
                   to overcome the Mad King. 
       01:24:59:02         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                      And since then, 
                     Arryn and Royce, 
       01:25:00:27         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                     Corbray, Waynwood, 
       01:25:02:17         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    all the great houses 
                    of the Vale watched 
                     from the corner. 
       01:25:05:23         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                       A timid boy  
                     at a tavern brawl. 
             Littlefinger is walking ahead of Royce and Anya. 
        
       01:25:07:22       ROYCE 
                    Are you questioning 
                      our courage? 
             Littlefinger stops and turns back to Anya and Royce.  
             They stand facing each other. 
       01:25:10:06    LITTLEFINGER 
                      I want to know 
                    which side you're on. 
       01:25:13:05         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                      Do you support 
                      the Lannisters, 
       01:25:14:19         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   the house that executed 
                   your friend Ned Stark? 
       01:25:16:27         
                         ROYCE 
                     Of course we don't 
                     support the damn 
                       Lannisters. 
       01:25:19:04         
                      LITTLEFINGER 
                   No? Catelyn Stark begged 
                   her sister for support 
                     and Lysa refused. 
       01:25:23:02         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                  By staying out of the fray, 
                 you've allowed Tywin Lannister 
       01:25:26:02         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    to destroy his rivals 
                   on every compass point. 
                           
                           
                           
       01:25:28:20  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                       Who stands 
                     against him now? 
       01:25:30:05         
                         ANYA 
                     Who would you have 
                   us back, Lord Baelish? 
       01:25:32:24         
                         ANYA 
                    Robb Stark is dead. 
       01:25:34:19         
                      LITTLEFINGER 
                 I'd have you back Robin Arryn, 
       01:25:37:06         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                     Lord of the Vale. 
       01:25:38:26         
                         ANYA 
                      Robin Arryn is 
                    a sickly little boy. 
       01:25:40:26         
             Littlefinger gestures with a pointed finger. 
                      LITTLEFINGER 
                   And sickly little boys 
                 sometimes become powerful men. 
       01:25:44:11         
                         ANYA 
                       More often 
                      they die young. 
             Royce, Anya, and Littlefinger continue walking with 
             Littlefinger leading the way. 
              
       01:25:46:10    LITTLEFINGER 
                I adored Lysa with all my heart. 
       01:25:49:02  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    But she loved her son 
                    so much, she became 
                      overprotective. 
       01:25:53:00         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                     He needs to learn 
                    how to swing a sword. 
       01:25:55:22         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    How to ride a horse. 
       01:25:57:03         
                         ROYCE 
                      Aye, it's time. 
                      LITTLEFINGER 
                      Yes, it's time. 
       01:26:00:03         
                      LITTLEFINGER 
                      Time for him 
                     to tour the Vale, 
       01:26:02:00         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   to visit all the castles 
                      in his domain. 
       01:26:04:15         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                      Time for Robin 
                     to leave the nest. 
       01:26:16:27         
             EXT. MEEREEN – DAY 
             Soldiers take the Masters down from hanging on 
             crosses. 
             (grunts)  
              
              
              
       01:26:27:08  
             Barristan is looking on, turns, and starts for the 
             stairs to the castle. 
                         BOY 
                      Ser Barristan. 
             Barristan turns back to the boy. 
       01:26:29:18     BARRISTAN 
                         Yes? 
             The boy hands Barristan a rolled paper. 
       01:26:32:21   BARRISTAN (CONT’D) 
                      Who sent you? 
             The boy turns over the paper to show the seal of a 
             hand holding a ring. The boy runs off. Barristan 
             unrolls the paper, reads it, and looks up. He is 
             surprised. 
       01:27:10:10  
             Barristan joins Jorah on an outdoor balcony, where is 
             surveiling maps. 
                         JORAH 
                      Ser Barristan. 
                           
                       BARRISTAN 
                       Ser Jorah. 
       01:27:12:15         
                         JORAH 
                     Have I forgotten 
                     a council meeting? 
       01:27:15:10         
                       BARRISTAN 
                         No. 
                           
             Barristan places the rolled up paper on the table in 
             front of Jorah. 
       01:27:26:05       JORAH 
                      What's this? 
       01:27:28:04         
                       BARRISTAN 
                      A royal pardon 
       01:27:29:23         
                     BARRISTAN (CONT’D) 
                  signed by Robert Baratheon. 
             Jorah opens the paper and looks at it. 
       01:27:45:25   BARRISTAN (CONT’D) 
                     You spied on her. 
       01:27:50:10         
                         JORAH 
                     Who gave you this? 
       01:27:51:20         
                       BARRISTAN 
                      Does it matter? 
             Barristan reaches for Jorah to give the paper back to 
             him. 
       01:28:02:27       JORAH 
                     Have you told her? 
       01:28:04:11         
                       BARRISTAN 
                  I wanted to tell you first, 
                       man-to-man 
       01:28:06:23         
                     BARRISTAN (CONT’D) 
                      rather than go 
                     behind your back. 
       01:28:13:04         
                         JORAH 
                      Let me speak 
                    with her in private. 
       01:28:15:01         
                       BARRISTAN 
                    You'll never be alone 
                      with her again. 
             Barristan exits. 
       01:28:53:19 
             INT. MEEREENESE CASTLE – NIGHT 
              
             Jorah is walking down a hallway to the throne room. 
             Jorah approaches the throne and stands at the foot of 
             the stairs.  He walks halfway up the stairs and guards 
             move toward him. He stops. 
                        DAENERYS 
                    Why did the usurper 
                       pardon you? 
       01:28:59:07       JORAH 
                       If we could 
                      speak alone. 
       01:29:01:04         
                        DAENERYS 
                    No, speak to me here. 
       01:29:03:22         
                     DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                     Explain it to me. 
       01:29:06:06         
                         JORAH 
                     Who do you think 
                    sent this to Meereen? 
       01:29:08:12         
                      JORAH (CONT’D) 
                      Who profits? 
       01:29:10:09         
                      JORAH (CONT’D) 
                     This is the work 
                    of Tywin Lannister. 
                           
       01:29:12:11    JORAH (CONT’D) 
                   He wants to divide us. 
       01:29:14:08         
                      JORAH (CONT’D) 
                     If we're fighting 
                    each other, we're not 
                      fighting him. 
       01:29:16:27         
                        DAENERYS 
                    The pardon was signed 
                     the year we met. 
       01:29:21:18   DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                   Why were you pardoned? 
       01:29:23:05         
                     DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                    Unless you're saying

       01:29:28:06       JORAH 
                     It is not forged. 
       01:29:30:02         
                        DAENERYS 
                       Why, then? 
       01:29:32:01         
                         JORAH 
                   I sent letters to Varys, 
       01:29:33:25         
                      JORAH (CONT’D) 
                      the spymaster 
                     of King's Landing. 
       01:29:36:07         
                        DAENERYS 
                    What was the content 
                     of these letters? 
        
       01:29:38:16       JORAH 
                      Information. 
                           
                        DAENERYS 
                     What information? 
       01:29:41:01         
                         JORAH 
                    When you and Viserys 
                     arrived in Pentos. 
       01:29:44:03         
                      JORAH (CONT’D) 
                    His plan to marry you 
                      to Khal Drogo. 
       01:29:46:16         
                    JORAH (CONT’D - OS) 
                   When you were married. 
       01:29:48:22         
                      JORAH (CONT’D) 
                   When your brother died. 
       01:29:50:19         
                        DAENERYS 
                     You told him I was 
                   carrying Drogo's child? 
       01:29:53:02         
                         JORAH 
                         I— 
                        DAENERYS 
                       Yes or no? 
       01:29:54:25         
                         JORAH 
                       Khaleesi. 
                           
                      DAENERYS (OS) 
                    Don't call me that. 
                           
                           
                           
                           
       01:29:56:04   DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                     Did you tell him 
                 I was carrying Drogo's child? 
       01:30:01:20       JORAH 
                         Yes. 
       01:30:06:07         
             Daenerys rises and approaches Jorah. 
                        DAENERYS 
                     That wine merchant 
                     tried to poison me 
       01:30:08:13         
                     DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                  because of your information. 
       01:30:09:27         
                         JORAH 
                      I stopped you  
                   from drinking his wine. 
       01:30:11:21         
                        DAENERYS 
                     Because you knew 
                     it was poisoned. 
       01:30:13:23       JORAH 
                      I suspected. 
       01:30:16:01      DAENERYS 
                      You betrayed me 
       01:30:18:14   DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                      from the first. 
       01:30:20:22       JORAH 
                       Forgive me. 
                           
             Jorah drops to his knees and looks down. 
       01:30:23:19         
                      JORAH (CONT’D) 
                      I never meant-- 
       01:30:25:28    JORAH (CONT’D) 
                     please, Khaleesi,  
                       forgive me. 
                           
             Jorah looks up at Daenerys. 
       01:30:27:29  
             Daenerys looks up and away into the distance. 
                        DAENERYS 
                   You sold my secrets to 
                  the man who killed my father 
       01:30:30:28   DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                and stole my brother's throne... 
                           
                         JORAH 
                    I have protected you. 
       01:30:33:00    JORAH (CONT’D) 
                      Fought for you. 
       01:30:34:12    Killed for you. 
                        DAENERYS 
                     ...and you want me  
                      to forgive you? 
       01:30:38:01       JORAH 
                     I have loved you. 
       01:30:39:27      DAENERYS 
                         Love? 
                           
                           
                           
       01:30:41:26   DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                     Love? How can you 
                      say that to me? 
       01:30:44:28         
                   DAENERYS (CONT’D - OS) 
                      Any other man, 
                     and I would have 
                      you executed. 
       01:30:47:26         
                     DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                     But you, I do not 
                    want you in my city 
                      dead or alive. 
       01:30:51:02   DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                   Go back to your masters 
                     in King's Landing. 
       01:30:54:15   DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                    Collect your pardon 
                       if you can. 
       01:31:00:10  
             Jorah rises, approaches Daenerys, and reaches out for 
             her hand. 
                         JORAH 
                     Daenerys, please. 
       01:31:01:26  
             Daenerys pulls her hand away. 
                        DAENERYS 
                     Don't ever presume 
                     to touch me again 
       01:31:05:10   DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                     or speak my name. 
       01:31:06:23   DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                    You have until dusk 
                   to collect your things 
       01:31:08:17   DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                    and leave this city. 
       01:31:10:03  DAENERYS (CONT’D - OS) 
                  If you're found in Meereen 
                     past break of day, 
       01:31:12:29   DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                    I'll have your head 
                   thrown into Slaver's Bay. 
             Jorah nods. 
       01:31:18:01   DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                         Go. 
       01:31:21:12         
                     DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                         Now. 
             Jorah looks down and turns to leave. 
       01:31:34:04  
             (footsteps departing)  
             Jorah rides out of Meereen on horseback. 
       01:32:18:10  
             EXT. FIELD – DAY 
              
             Ramsay’s army meets Roose’s army in a field.  Ramsay 
             presents Roose with the flag of Moat Cailin. 
                        RAMSAY 
                       Moat Cailin 
                     is yours, Father. 
        
       01:32:27:25       ROOSE 
                      Walk with me. 
       01:32:30:06  
             Roose and Ramsay walk up a hill with their armies in a 
             valley behind them.   
                      ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                      Has there been 
                    any word from Locke? 
       01:32:31:28      RAMSAY 
       01:32:33:29       No. 
                         ROOSE 
                      Unimportant. 
       01:32:35:13    ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                       A cripple, 
                      a young boy. 
       01:32:37:14    ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                    none of the northern 
                    lords have seen them. 
       01:32:40:14    ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                     Dead most likely. 
       01:32:45:15    ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                    Most of the ironborn 
                    have fled the North. 
       01:32:48:08    ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                    Now more will follow, 
                      thanks to you. 
       01:32:54:17  
             Roose and Ramsay reach the hilltop at an overlook. 
        
                      ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                    Tell me what you see. 
       01:32:59:09      RAMSAY 
                    Moors, fields, hills. 
       01:33:03:28  
             Roose moves closer to Ramsay. 
                         ROOSE 
                    Tell me what you see. 
       01:33:11:04  
             Ramsay looks around and shakes his head. 
                        Ramsay 
                        Nothing. 
       01:33:13:10       ROOSE  
                      Not nothing. 
       01:33:14:27    ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                       The North. 
       01:33:17:06 
             Roose outstretches his arm and gestures in a 
             direction. 
                      ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                   Ride 700 miles that way, 
                  you're still in the North. 
       01:33:20:04         
             Roose outstretches his arm and gestures in another 
             direction. 
                      ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                    400 miles that way. 
       01:33:23:00  
             Roose looks in another direction. Ramsay follows and 
             looks in the same direction. 
                      ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                    300 miles that way. 
       01:33:25:05  
             Roose looks back at Ramsay. 
                      ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                    The North is larger 
                     than the other six 
                     kingdoms combined. 
       01:33:29:02    ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                    And I am the Warden 
       01:33:30:26    of the North. 
                      ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                     The North is mine. 
       01:33:35:07  
             Ramsay looks off in the distance.  
                      ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                      Now tell me, 
                     what is your name? 
             Ramsay looks back to Roose. 
       01:33:41:05      RAMSAY 
                      Ramsay Snow. 
       01:33:43:17       ROOSE 
                    No, not Ramsay Snow. 
             Roose hands Ramsay a rolled up paper. 
              
        
        
       01:33:46:28    ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                        Open it. 
             Ramsay unrolls the paper and looks at it. 
       01:33:49:17    ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                      From this day 
                    until your last day, 
       01:33:51:27    ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                   you are Ramsay Bolton, 
       01:33:53:19         
                      ROOSE (CONT’D) 
                    son of Roose Bolton, 
                    Warden of the North. 
             Ramsay looks up at Roose. 
       01:34:02:26 
             Ramsay kneels before Roose. 
                        RAMSAY 
                      You honor me. 
       01:34:05:03    RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                      I swear I will 
                     uphold your name 
       01:34:08:02  RAMSAY (CONT’D - OS) 
                    and your tradition. 
       01:34:10:04    RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                     I will be worthy 
                      of you, Father, 
       01:34:12:14    RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                       I promise. 
       01:34:33:08  
             The army on horseback marches together in a trail, led 
             by Roose, Ramsay, and Reek. 
                      RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                       Come, Reek, 
                   I'll be needing a bath. 
             Reek looks over to Ramsay seated on the horse next to 
             him. They continue riding. 
       01:35:03:26  
             INT. THE EYRIE – DAY 
              
             Sansa sits alone. 
             (knocks)  
       01:35:05:22       SANSA 
                         Yes? 
             Door opens and Littlefinger enters. 
       01:35:10:26 
             (door closes)  
       01:35:20:26  
             Sansa sits doing her embroidery as Littlefinger looks 
             on. 
                     LITTLEFINGER (OS) 
                    First time I saw you, 
                   you were just a child. 
       01:35:23:17  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D - OS) 
                    A girl from the North 
                    come to the capital 
                    for the first time. 
       01:35:26:19  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   Not a child any longer. 
       01:35:32:21  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    Why did you help me? 
       01:35:34:29       SANSA 
                  They would have thrown you 
                    through the Moon Door 
       01:35:37:12         
                      SANSA (CONT’D) 
                      if they found 
                       you guilty. 
       01:35:39:03    LITTLEFINGER 
                    That's not an answer. 
       01:35:44:18  
             Sansa pauses on her embroidery. 
                         SANSA 
                  If they'd have executed you, 
       01:35:46:10    SANSA (CONT’D) 
                      what would they 
                     have done with me? 
       01:35:48:25    LITTLEFINGER 
                      I don't know. 
       01:35:51:06       SANSA 
                      Neither do I. 
       01:35:54:28    LITTLEFINGER 
                     Better to gamble 
                    on the man you know 
       01:35:56:29  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                     than the strangers  
                       you don't? 
       01:36:00:22  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                  And you think you know me? 
       01:36:04:11       SANSA 
                    I know what you want. 
       01:36:06:03    LITTLEFINGER 
                        Do you? 
             Sansa looks up at Littlefinger. They make eye contact 
             and Sansa looks back down. 
       01:36:23:16  
             EXT. A ROCKY PASSAGE – DAY 
              
             Hound and Arya are walking together. 
                         ARYA 
                       I thought 
                    it'd make me happy, 
       01:36:25:04         
                      ARYA (CONT’D) 
                      but it doesn't. 
       01:36:27:05     Not really. 
                         HOUND 
                   Nothing makes you happy. 
       01:36:29:07         
                         ARYA 
                 Lots of things make me happy. 
                           
                         HOUND 
                       Like what? 
       01:36:31:00         
                         ARYA 
                     Killing Polliver, 
                      killing Rorge. 
                           
                           
                           
                           
       01:36:32:26       HOUND 
                    So you're sad because 
                   you didn't get to kill 
                     Joffrey yourself. 
       01:36:36:07         
                      HOUND (CONT’D) 
                       Is that it? 
       01:36:37:18         
                         ARYA 
                     At least I could 
                   have been there to watch. 
       01:36:39:08       ARYA 
                      I wanted to see 
                    the look in his eyes 
                   when he knew it was over. 
       01:36:42:06       HOUND 
                   Aye, nothing in the world 
                     beats that look. 
       01:36:45:19       ARYA 
                     You protected him 
                    for most of his life. 
       01:36:48:06    ARYA (CONT’D) 
                      You think you 
                    could have saved him? 
       01:36:49:18       HOUND 
                 I wasn't the damn wine taster. 
             Hound takes a drink. 
       01:36:54:19    HOUND (CONT’D) 
                    Little shit deserved 
                    to die, but poison-- 
       01:36:58:26    HOUND (CONT’D) 
                  poison's a woman's weapon. 
       01:37:01:23    HOUND (CONT’D) 
                    Men kill with steel. 
       01:37:03:19         
                         ARYA 
                     That's your stupid 
                      pride talking. 
       01:37:05:09    ARYA (CONT’D) 
                    It's why you'll never 
                     be a great killer. 
       01:37:07:15    ARYA (CONT’D) 
                  I'd have killed Joffrey with 
                  a chicken bone if I had to. 
       01:37:10:13  
             (laughs)  
       01:37:11:29       HOUND 
                     I'd pay good money 
                       to see that. 
       01:37:14:27  
             (groans) 
              
             Hound touches the wound on his throat.  
       01:37:17:20       ARYA 
                      You should have 
                      let me burn it. 
       01:37:20:20       HOUND 
                     It's a fleabite. 
        
        
       01:37:23:09       ARYA 
                    That fleabite's got 
                   you walking a lot slower 
                     than you used to. 
             Hound and Arya are approaching The Eyrie. 
       01:37:26:23       HOUND 
                      Well, we won't 
                      have to walk 
                     too much further. 
       01:37:30:06       ARYA 
                       You really 
                      think my aunt 
                     will pay for me? 
       01:37:31:28       HOUND 
                     Aye, she'll pay. 
       01:37:33:21         
                         ARYA 
                      I've never even 
                        met her. 
       01:37:35:03       HOUND 
                      Doesn't matter. 
                     You're her blood. 
       01:37:39:21    HOUND (CONT’D) 
                      Family, honor, 
                    all that horseshit. 
       01:37:43:03    HOUND (CONT’D) 
                     It's all you lords 
                  and ladies ever talk about. 
                           
             A knight on the high ground slings and arrow and aims 
             at Hound and Arya.  
       01:37:45:21       ARYA 
                      I'm not a lady. 
       01:37:49:08     KNIGHT (OS) 
                      Who would pass 
                     the Bloody Gate? 
       01:37:51:07       HOUND 
                     The bloody Hound, 
                      Sandor Clegane. 
       01:37:54:16         
                      HOUND (CONT’D) 
                       And his... 
       01:37:56:27         
                      HOUND (CONT’D) 
                    traveling companion 
                       Arya Stark, 
       01:38:00:02    HOUND (CONT’D) 
                     niece of your lady 
                       Lysa Arryn. 
       01:38:02:29      KNIGHT 
                      Then I offer 
                      my condolences. 
       01:38:05:25    KNIGHT (CONT’D) 
                     Lady Arryn died. 
       01:38:11:13    KNIGHT (CONT’D) 
                      Three days ago. 
       01:38:16:06  
             (laughing) 
              
             Arya breaks out into hysterical laughing.  
        
       01:38:25:01  
             (laughing continues)  
       01:38:31:14  
             INT. THE EYRIE – DAY 
              
             Robin is descending the stairs in the throne room with 
             Littlefinger. 
                         ROBIN 
                    I've never left home 
                    before, Uncle Petyr. 
       01:38:33:19    ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                    The Lord of the Vale 
                    belongs in the Eyrie, 
                      Mother said. 
       01:38:38:27    ROBIN (CONT’D) 
                     She said it's not 
                      safe outside. 
       01:38:41:11    LITTLEFINGER 
                      It wasn't safe  
                      for her inside. 
       01:38:43:04         
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                       People die 
                   at their dinner tables. 
       01:38:46:27  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   They die in their beds. 
       01:38:49:00  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                     They die squatting 
                   over their chamber pots. 
             Littlefinger stops and turns back to Robin. 
        
        
       01:38:52:17  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                      Everybody dies 
                     sooner or later. 
       01:38:54:29  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                 Don't worry about your death. 
       01:38:56:24  
             Littlefinger moves toward Robin and puts his hands on 
             his shoulders. 
                    LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   Worry about your life. 
       01:38:59:16  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   Take charge of your life 
       01:39:02:01  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                   for as long as it lasts. 
       01:39:04:12  LITTLEFINGER (CONT’D) 
                    That is what it means 
                   to be Lord of the Vale. 
       01:39:07:14  
             (footsteps)  
             Littlefinger looks up to see Sansa entering at the top 
             of the staircase. Sansa walks down to join them. 
       01:39:31:14       SANSA 
                      Shall we go? 
       01:39:40:23  
             INT. KING’S LANDING DUNGEONS – DAY 
             Tyrion, leaning, takes a drink. 
                        TYRION 
                     Wine always helps. 
       01:39:44:24 
             Tyrion turns back to look at Jaime. 
        
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                       I thank you 
                        for it. 
       01:39:48:21         
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     Trial by combat. 
       01:39:52:02    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   Deciding a man's guilt 
                      or innocence 
       01:39:55:02    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   in the eyes of the gods 
       01:39:57:06    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   by having two other men 
                  hack each other to pieces. 
       01:40:00:01    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    Tells you something 
                      about the gods. 
             Tyrion stops leaning against a beam and takes a few 
             steps, facing Jaime. 
       01:40:05:03    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     How much longer? 
       01:40:06:25         
                         JAIME 
                         Soon. 
       01:40:12:07      TYRION 
                      Do you think 
                    Oberyn has a chance? 
             Jaime shrugs. 
       01:40:17:04    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   The Red Viper of Dorne. 
       01:40:19:09    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    You don't get a name 
                   like that unless you're 
                      deadly, right? 
       01:40:21:18     JAIME (OS) 
                  I've never seen him fight. 
       01:40:22:29         
                        TYRION 
                   Oh, he's going to die. 
                     I'm going to die. 
       01:40:25:23       JAIME 
                  Oberyn believes in himself. 
       01:40:27:03         
                        TYRION 
                   That's putting it mildly. 
       01:40:30:13    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    What's the punishment 
                      for regicide? 
                           
             Tyrion walks toward Jaime. 
       01:40:32:13    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   Drawing and quartering? 
                        Hanging? 
       01:40:35:12         
                    TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                   Breaking at the wheel? 
                           
                         JAIME 
                       Beheading. 
       01:40:37:22         
                       TYRION (OS) 
                      Seems rather 
                       ordinary. 
       01:40:39:09  TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                    And he was my nephew 
                   as well, so what is that? 
             Tyrion is taking a piss. 
       01:40:41:25    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   Fratricide is brothers. 
       01:40:43:14    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     Filicide is sons. 
       01:40:46:22  
             Tyrion looks back at Jaime. 
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                       Nepoticide. 
                      That's the one. 
       01:40:51:24    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    Matricide, patricide, 
       01:40:54:11    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    infanticide, suicide. 
       01:40:58:26    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     There's no kind of 
                    killing that doesn't 
                     have its own word. 
                           
             Tyrion finishes taking a piss and returns to the 
             opposite side of the room. 
        
       01:41:01:09       JAIME 
                        Cousins. 
       01:41:03:03     TYRION (OS) 
                   Cousins, you're right. 
       01:41:05:09    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     There is no word 
                    for cousin killing. 
       01:41:07:02         
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                       Well done. 
                           
             Tyrion nods at Jaime and sits down. 
       01:41:09:01    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                 Do you remember cousin Orson? 
                     Orson Lannister? 
       01:41:11:27       JAIME 
                       Of course. 
                     Wet-nurse dropped 
                     him on his head. 
       01:41:14:12       JAIME 
                     Left him simple. 
                           
                       TYRION (OS) 
                        Simple? 
       01:41:16:29         
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    Used to sit all day 
                      in the garden. 
       01:41:19:01         
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     Crushing beetles 
                      with a rock. 
                           
       01:41:20:24  
             Jaime and Tyrion mime banging beetles to death with a 
             rock. 
             (both grunting)  
              
       01:41:24:12  
             (chuckles)  TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   Nothing made him happier. 
       01:41:26:18         
                         JAIME 
                   Nothing made you happier. 
       01:41:28:01         
                      JAIME (CONT’D) 
                     You'd think being 
                    tormented from birth 
       01:41:30:00         
                      JAIME (CONT’D) 
                   would have given you some 
                  affinity for the afflicted. 
       01:41:32:04         
                        TYRION 
                     On the contrary. 
                    Laughing at another 
                      person's misery 
       01:41:35:09         
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     was the only thing 
                     that made me feel 
                    like everyone else. 
       01:41:37:09         
                         JAIME 
                  The joke wore thin, though. 
       01:41:39:12         
                       TYRION (OS) 
                        For you.  
                     You drifted away. 
                           
       01:41:41:08       JAIME 
                   I had other interests. 
       01:41:42:25         
                        TYRION 
                    Yes, other interests. 
       01:41:47:05    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   But I stayed with Orson. 
       01:41:48:27         
                       JAIME (OS) 
                         Why? 
       01:41:50:25      TYRION 
                      I was curious. 
       01:41:52:12         
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    Why was he smashing 
                     all those beetles? 
       01:41:54:23    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                       What did he 
                      get out of it? 
       01:41:56:13         
                    TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                     First thing I did 
                      was ask him. 
       01:41:58:17    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  "Orson, why are you smashing 
                    all those beetles?" 
       01:42:02:10  TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                    He gave me an answer. 
                    "Smash the beetles. 
                           
                           
                           
       01:42:05:10    TYRION (CONT’D) 
             (grunting) Smash 'em." 
              
             Jaime smiles.  
              
       01:42:09:12  TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                     I wasn't deterred. 
       01:42:11:04    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                I was the smartest person I knew. 
       01:42:12:27    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                      Certainly I had 
                     the wherewithal to 
                    unravel the mysteries 
       01:42:15:09         
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    that lay at the heart 
                       of a moron. 
       01:42:17:04    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                      So I went to 
                  Maester Volarik's library. 
       01:42:20:16         
             Jaime grimaces. 
                         JAIME 
                        Volarik. 
                   Tried to touch me once. 
       01:42:22:22      TYRION 
                       Turns out, 
                    far too much has been 
                   written about great men 
        
        
       01:42:25:12    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                and not nearly enough about morons. 
       01:42:27:15    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    Doesn't seem right. 
       01:42:30:00         
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                      In any case, 
                      I found nothing 
       01:42:31:23    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  that illuminated the nature 
                    of Orson's affliction 
       01:42:33:28    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   or the reason behind his 
                  relentless beetle slaughter. 
       01:42:36:25         
                    TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                      So I went back 
                      to the source. 
       01:42:39:08  TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                   I may not have been able 
                    to speak with Orson, 
       01:42:41:10    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   but I could observe him, 
                       watch him 
       01:42:44:02    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   the way men watch animals 
       01:42:46:12    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                       to come to 
                   a deeper understanding 
                     of their behavior. 
             Tyrion picks up a bug off the floor. 
       01:42:51:29  TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                     And as I watched, 
       01:42:53:13    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   I became more and more 
                       sure of it. 
       01:42:55:29    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    There was something 
                     happening there. 
                           
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     His face was like 
                     the page of a book 
                           
             Tyrion examines the bug in his hand. 
       01:43:01:27         
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    written in a language 
                    I didn't understand. 
       01:43:03:28         
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   But he wasn't mindless. 
                    He had his reasons. 
       01:43:06:26  TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                   And I became possessed 
                  with knowing what they were. 
       01:43:10:03         
                    TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                  I began to spend inordinate 
                 amounts of time watching him. 
       01:43:13:20         
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    I would eat my lunch 
                      in the garden, 
       01:43:16:10    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     chewing my mutton 
                     to the music of... 
       01:43:18:12         
             (grunting)  
              
       01:43:20:07    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     And when I wasn't 
                    watching him, I was 
                    thinking about him. 
       01:43:23:02    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   Father droned on about 
                     the family legacy 
       01:43:25:23         
                    TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                    and I thought about 
                     Orson's beetles. 
       01:43:27:19         
                    TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                    I read the histories 
                   of Targaryen conquests. 
       01:43:30:16    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  Did I hear dragon wings? No. 
       01:43:32:18         
                       TYRION (CONT’D) 
             (grunting)   I heard... 
        
       01:43:35:22  TYRION (CONT’D - OS) 
                  And I still couldn't figure 
                   out why he was doing it. 
       01:43:39:16    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     And I had to know, 
                   because it was horrible 
       01:43:41:28    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                      that all these 
                   beetles should be dying 
                      for no reason. 
       01:43:45:06       JAIME 
                  Every day around the world, 
       01:43:46:25    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   men, women, and children 
                  are murdered by the score. 
       01:43:50:08    JAIME (CONT’D) 
                   Who gives a dusty fuck 
                   about a bunch of beetles? 
       01:43:53:04     TYRION (OS) 
                      I know, I know. 
                    But still, it filled 
                      me with dread. 
       01:43:55:28    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   Piles and piles of them, 
                   years and years of them. 
       01:43:59:15         
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   How many countless living 
                      crawling things 
       01:44:01:10    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    smashed and dried out 
                   and returned to the dirt? 
       01:44:04:10    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  In my dreams I found myself 
        
        
       01:44:06:26    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    standing on a beach 
                    made of beetle husks 
       01:44:09:11    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     stretching as far 
                    as the eye could see. 
       01:44:11:10    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     I woke up crying, 
       01:44:13:13    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     weeping for their 
                   shattered little bodies. 
       01:44:16:01    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                      I tried to stop 
                       Orson once. 
       01:44:18:08       JAIME 
                   He was twice your size. 
       01:44:19:21      TYRION 
                     He just pushed me 
                    aside with a "kuuh" 
       01:44:21:16         
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    and kept on smashing. 
       01:44:24:01    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                      Every day until  
                       that mule 
       01:44:26:20    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   kicked him in the chest 
                      and killed him. 
             Tyrion looks down and frees his captured bug. 
       01:44:39:14    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    So what do you think? 
       01:44:41:28    TYRION (CONT’D) 
                     Why did he do it? 
       01:44:44:12         
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                   What was it all about? 
       01:44:50:11       JAIME 
                      I don't know. 
       01:44:54:21  
             (bells tolling) 
              
             Jaime and Tyrion look in the direction of the bells. 
             Jaime rises and moves to the door.  
       01:45:11:03  
             Jaime looks meekly back at Tyrion. 
                         JAIME 
                     Good luck today. 
             Jaime exits.  
              
       01:45:18:28  
             (door closes)  
              
             Tyrion stares at the closed door. 
              
       01:45:30:16  
             EXT. KING’S LANDING – DAY 
              
             Tyrion is escorted to a crowded courtyard. 
              
             (crowd shouting)  
              
             Jaime is seated with the court, onlooking. 
       01:45:45:17 
             Tyrion approaches Oberyn, who is being hugged by 
             Ellaria. 
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                  Looks like very light armor. 
       01:45:47:14  
             Oberyn leaves Ellaria’s embrace to prepare for battle. 
                        OBERYN 
                   I like to move around. 
       01:45:48:27      TYRION  
                     You could at least 
                      wear a helmet. 
       01:45:52:23 
             Oberyn is drinking wine. 
                      TYRION (CONT’D) 
                    You shouldn't drink 
                      before a fight. 
       01:45:54:15      OBERYN 
                      You learn this 
                     during your years 
                    in the fighting pits? 
       01:45:56:25    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                      I always drink  
                      before a fight. 
       01:45:59:06      TYRION 
                   It could get you killed. 
                   It could get me killed. 
       01:46:01:24         
             Oberyn puts down his goblet and looks to Ellaria. 
        
                        OBERYN 
                      Today is not 
                      the day I die. 
                           
             Ellaria strokes his chest. 
       01:46:07:02         
             (crowd cheering)  
             The Mountain enters the ring as Ellaria and Oberyn 
             look on. 
       01:46:12:05      ELLARIA 
                  You're going to fight that? 
       01:46:13:25         
                        OBERYN 
                   I'm going to kill that. 
       01:46:20:19         
                      ELLARIA (OS) 
                    He is the biggest man 
                      I've ever seen. 
       01:46:22:15      OBERYN 
                    Size does not matter 
                     when you are flat 
                      on your back. 
       01:46:25:02         
                        TYRION 
                      Thank the gods. 
       01:46:26:14  
             (horn blows)   
       01:46:29:00  
             Pycelle addressed court and the crowd standing in the 
             courtyard. 
                        PYCELLE 
                    In the sight of gods 
                        and men, 
       01:46:32:01         
                     PYCELLE (CONT’D) 
                   we gather to ascertain 
       01:46:34:11   PYCELLE (CONT’D) 
                   the guilt or innocence 
                       of this... 
             Jaime looks in Cersei’s direction. 
       01:46:38:21  PYCELLE (CONT’D - OS) 
                    man Tyrion Lannister. 
             Tyrion looks up at Cersei. 
       01:46:41:14  PYCELLE (CONT’D - OS) 
                    May the Mother grant 
                       them mercy. 
       01:46:43:18  PYCELLE (CONT’D - OS) 
                   May the Father give them 
                 such justice as they deserve. 
             Ellaria stands with Oberyn, her arms around him, 
             stroking his chest. A man stands polishing Oberyn’s 
             sword. 
       01:46:47:23  PYCELLE (CONT’D - OS) 
                    And may the Warrior 
                     guide the hand... 
             Tywin impatiently motions for the battle to start. 
       01:46:50:20  
             (horn blows)  
                     PYCELLE (CONT’D) 
                    ...of our champion-- 
             Pycelle bows and exits the ring. 
       01:47:01:18  
             Ellaria kisses Oberyn and holds his hand. The Mountain 
             draws his blade. 
                        ELLARIA 
                      Don't leave me 
                    alone in this world. 
       01:47:03:25      OBERYN 
                        Never. 
                           
            Oberyn enters the ring. A man throws Oberyn a spear, 
            with which he proceeds to fancily maneuver around the 
            ring. 
       01:47:18:03  
             (crowd cheering)  
       01:47:26:04  
             Oberyn turns to The Mountain. 
                      OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                     Have they told you 
                       who I am? 
       01:47:27:26         
                        MOUNTAIN 
                      Some dead man. 
             The Mountain takes the first swing at Oberyn with his 
             sword. 
       01:47:34:17      OBERYN 
                     I am the brother 
                     of Elia Martell. 
       01:47:37:08    OBERYN (CON’T) 
                  Do you know why I have come 
                  all the way to this stinking 
        
        
       01:47:40:11    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                    shit-pile of a city? 
       01:47:42:19    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                        For you. 
             Oberyn makes a charge at The Mountain with his sword. 
             He hits The Mountain in the head. 
       01:47:49:01    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                    I'm going to hear you 
                   confess before you die. 
       01:47:51:29         
                      OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                    You raped my sister. 
       01:47:53:29    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                     You murdered her. 
       01:47:55:13    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                   You killed her children. 
       01:47:57:09    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                    Say it now and we can 
                     make this quick. 
       01:48:00:02  
             The Mountain charges Oberyn. They fight. 
             (shouting)  
        
       01:48:08:04 
             Oberyn knocks off The Mountain’s helmet. The Mountain 
             charges back at him and the fighting continues. 
                      OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                        Say it. 
                      You raped her. 
       01:48:12:11    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                     You murdered her. 
       01:48:14:29  
             (shouts)  
       01:48:17:19    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                   You killed her children. 
             Oberyn escapes an entrapment. 
       01:48:29:03  
             (growls)  
       01:48:30:15    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                      You raped her! 
       01:48:31:26    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
       01:48:33:04   You murdered her! 
                      OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                   You killed her children! 
       01:48:35:06  
             The Mountain knocks Oberyn down. 
             (grunts)  
              
             Oberyn rises and charges at The Mountain. 
              
             The Mountain breaks Oberyn’s spear then knocks it from 
             his hands. 
       01:48:50:11 
             Oberyn escapes an entrapment by flipping out of it. 
             (crowd cheering)  
        
        
        
        
       01:49:08:17 
             The Mountain knocks Oberyn to the ground. Oberyn 
             counters and runs The Mountain through with the 
             remainder of his spear. 
             (groans)  
       01:49:14:11    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
       01:49:16:00    You raped her! 
                      OBERYN (CONT’D) 
       01:49:20:13   You murdered her! 
             Oberyn slices The Mountain’s leg. The Mountain falls 
             on one knee. 
             (screams)  
       01:49:27:14    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                   You killed her children! 
                           
             Oberyn charges The Mountain and stabs him again. 
       01:49:30:01         
             (groans)  
       01:49:31:21  
             Jaime smiles. 
             (crowd clamoring)   
        
       01:49:36:28 
             The Mountain lays on the ground with a spear sticking 
             out of him as Oberyn circles him. 
                      OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                    Wait. Are you dying? 
       01:49:39:08    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                       No, no, no. 
       01:49:41:04    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                     You can't die yet. 
                   You haven't confessed. 
                           
             Oberyn removes his spear from The Mountain’s chest. 
                           
       01:49:46:10    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                        Say it. 
       01:49:48:29         
                      OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                      Say her name. 
                      Elia Martell. 
       01:49:52:20    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                      You raped her. 
                   You killed her children. 
       01:49:54:27    OBERYN (CONT’D)

       01:49:57:11         
             Oberyn points at Tywin. 
                      OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                      Who gave you 
                       the order?! 
       01:50:00:03    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                      Who gave you  
                       the order?! 
       01:50:01:24         
                    OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                      Say her name! 
       01:50:04:06    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                      You raped her! 
                     You murdered her! 
       01:50:06:08  OBERYN (CONT’D - OS) 
                   You killed her children. 
       01:50:08:15    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                        Say it. 
                      Say her name. 
             Oberyn looks up at Ellaria. 
       01:50:12:21    OBERYN (CONT’D) 
                        Say it! 
             (grunts)  
              
             The Mountain sweep kicks Oberyn off his feet. 
       01:50:16:26 
             The Mountain grabs Oberyn by the throat and chokes 
             him, then hits him in the face. Oberyn’s teeth are 
             knocked out. 
             (teeth rattle)  
       01:50:21:14 
             The Mountain climbs on top of Oberyn, choking him. 
                        MOUNTAIN 
                      Elia Martell. 
                           
             The Mountain squishes Oberyn’s eyes out with his 
             thumbs.       
       01:50:23:00  
             (screaming)  
       01:50:24:21   MOUNTAIN (CONT’D) 
       01:50:27:03  I killed her children. 
                     MOUNTAIN (CONT’D) 
                     Then I raped her. 
                           
       01:50:29:18   MOUNTAIN (CONT’D) 
                   Then I smashed her head 
                      in like this! 
                           
             The Mountain crushes Oberyn’s skull with his hands. 
       01:50:33:19         
             Ellaria covers her mouth with her hands, horrified. 
             (screaming)   
             The Mountain falls on the ground. Cersei smiles. 
             Tyrion closes his eyes and hangs his head. 
       01:50:46:09  
             Tywin rises. 
                         TYWIN 
                     The gods have made 
                     their will known. 
       01:50:49:18  TYWIN (CONT’D - OS) 
                     Tyrion Lannister, 
             Tyrion opens his eyes, looking defeated.  
       01:50:51:25 
             Jaime closes his eyes in anguish and hangs his head. 
                    TYWIN (CONT’D - OS) 
                  in the name of King Tommen 
                   of the House Baratheon, 
       01:50:54:13  TYWIN (CONT’D - OS) 
                     First of His Name, 
                           
             Cersei smiles down on Tyrion. 
       01:50:56:20    TYWIN (CONT’D) 
                      you are hereby  
                    sentenced to death. 
             Tyrion stands with his mouth hanging open.
