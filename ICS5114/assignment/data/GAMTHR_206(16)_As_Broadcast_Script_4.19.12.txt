           EXT. WINTERFELL - RAVENRY - DAY. 
                    
           Maester Luwin frantically rushes into the ravenry, barring 
           the door behind him. He moves to the writing table, 
           hurriedly scrawling a message, occasionally interrupted by 
           noises from outside. He ties the note to a raven's leg, 
           then tosses it from the open window just as several of 
           Theon's men enter and draw their swords. 
                    
           INT. WINTERFELL - BRAN’S CHAMBER - DAY. 
                    
           Theon strides into Bran's room, accompanied by Dagmer 
           Cleftjaw. Bran lies in bed. 
                          THEON  
                   I’ve taken your castle.  
                          BRAN  
                   Theon?  
                          THEON  
                   It’s Prince Theon now. Get up. You have 
                   to get dressed.  
                    
           Bran looks up at him, uncomprehending.  
                          THEON  
                   I’ve taken Winterfell. I took it. I am 
                   occupying it. I sent men over the walls 
                   with grappling claws and ropes.  
                          BRAN  
                   Why?  
                          THEON  
                   To take the castle.

                          THEON  
                   And he sent me back to Pyke. I’m a 
                   Greyjoy. I can’t fight for Robb and my 
                   father both. Where’s Hodor?  
                          BRAN  
                   I don’t know.

           Dagmer leaves. 
                          THEON  
                   My men are bringing your people 
                   together in the courtyard.  
                          BRAN  
                   Why?  
                          THEON  
                   So you and I can go down and tell them 
                   how you’ve yielded Winterfell to me. 
                          BRAN  
                   I won’t.  
                    
           Theon approaches the bed, angrily. 
                          THEON  
                   Yes, you will.  
                          BRAN  
                   I won’t. I’ll never yield. We’ll fight 
                   you and throw you out.  
                    
           Theon sighs, annoyed, and sits beside him.  
                          THEON  
                   The castle is mine, but these people 
                   are still yours. You’ll yield to keep 
                   them safe, to keep them alive. That’s 
                   what a good lord would do. Think 
                   carefully about what you want to

           EXT. WINTERFELL - COURTYARD - DAY. 
                    
           The smallfolk of Winterfell are gathered to hear from Bran. 
                          BRAN  
                   I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.  
                          THEON  
                   Louder. Say “Prince Theon.”  
                          BRAN  
                   I've yielded Winterfell to Prince 
                   Theon.

                          THEON  
                   My father has donned the ancient crown 
                   of salt and rock and declared himself 
                   King of the Iron Islands. He claims the 
                   north as well, by right of conquest. 
                   You are all his subjects.  
                          FARLEN  
                   Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you 
                   think you can hold the north with this 
                   lot… 
                    
           One of the Ironmen hits Farlen hard with his truncheon, 
           knocking him to the ground. One of the women helps him back 
           to his feet. 
                          THEON  
                   If you serve me as loyally as you 
                   served Ned Stark, I will be as good to 
                   you as he ever was. Betray me and you 
                   will wish you hadn’t. Maester Luwin. 
                   Send a raven to Pyke, informing my 
                   father of my victory here. And one to 
                   Deepwood Motte, to my sister. Inform 
                   her that she’s to bring five hundred 
                   men to Winterfell.

                   Ser Rodrik. It grieves me that we meet 
                   as foes.  
                          RODRIK  
                   It grieves me you’ve got less honor 
                   than a back alley whore. You were 
                   raised here, under this roof.  These 
                   people are your people… 
                          THEON  
                   They are not my people.  
                          RODRIK  
                   King Robb thought of you as a brother.

                          THEON  
                   My brothers are dead. They died 
                   fighting Stark men. Men like you… 
                          RODRIK  
                   Aye, they died fighting a war your 
                   father started. Lord Stark raised you 
                   among his own sons…

                          THEON  
                   Among them, but not one of them. I was 
                   his hostage. Taken from my home. 
                          RODRIK  
                   If he were alive to see this… 
                          THEON  
                   He’s not. He’s dead. The Seven Kingdoms 
                   are at war. And Winterfell is mine.  
                          RODRIK  
                   I should have put a sword in your belly 
                   instead of in your hand.  
                          THEON  
                   You’ve served this house faithfully, 
                   old man, but keep talking and I’ll… 
                    
           Rodrik spits in Theon's face. One of the Ironmen clubs him 
           roughly.   
                          THEON  
                   Take him to the cells! Lock him up for… 
                          DAGMER  
                   My Prince. You can’t let that stand. He 
                   must pay.  
                          THEON  
                   I’ll lock him in a cell until he rots 
                   like… 
                          DAGMER  
                   No. He has to pay the iron price. 
                   They’ll never respect you while he 
                   lives.  
      01:07:46      
                    
           Theon hesitates, having known Rodrik for years. He looks at 
           Rodrik, then at Bran and the others. He knows Dagmer is 
           right.

                   Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death.     
                          BRAN  
                   No! You said no harm would come to them 
                   if I yielded!  
                          THEON  
                   The old man couldn’t keep his mouth 
                   shut.  
                    
           Luwin approaches Theon.  
                          LUWIN  
                   I urge you not to make a hasty 
                   decision.  
                          THEON  
                   He disrespected me in front of my men. 
                   That was his decision, not mine.  
                          LUWIN  
                   He’s worth more to you alive than dead. 
                   The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, 
                   think what you do.  
                    
           Theon looks to Dagmer, who’s unmoved.  
                          THEON  
                   You’ll address me as Prince Theon or 
                   you’ll be next.  
                          DAGMER 
                   Come on. 
                    
           The two guards drag Rodrik over to a stone bench. 
                          BRAN  
                   No!  
                          RICKON (O.S) 
                   No! Theon! 
                          BRAN (O.S.) 
                   Rodrik! Please, Theon, please! 
                    
           Dagmer stands with his sword at the ready.

                          RODRIK  
                   (to Theon)  
                   He who passes the sentence should swing 
                   the sword. Coward.  
                          BRAN (O.S.) 
                   Please, I'm begging you! 
                    
           The Ironmen force Rodrik down over the bench. Theon draws 
           his sword. 
                          BRAN  
                   (to Theon)  
                   Stop! Stop right now!  
                          THEON  
                   You don’t give commands anymore, little 
                   lord.  
                          BRAN  
                   Please! Stop him, somebody stop him!  
                    
           Rodrik looks over at Bran, accepting his fate and trying to 
           soothe the boy. 
                          RODRIK  
                   Hush now, child. I’m off to see your 
                   father.  
                          BRAN (O.S.) 
                   You said no harm would come! Said no 
                   harm would come to him, please! 
                    
           Rickon looks away, sobbing. 
                          THEON  
                   Any last words, old man?  
                    
           Rodrik raises his head and looks Theon in the eyes.

                   Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you 
                   are truly lost.  
                          BRAN (O.S.) 
                   Theon, please don't!  
                          RICKON (O.S.) 
                   Do something!

                   No, please stop it! 
                    
           Theon attempts to behead Rodrik in a single slash, but 
           misses and hits the man in the upper back. He withdraws the 
           sword, trying again, and blood flies as he makes a mess of 
           the execution. The crowd looks away, and Dagmer looks 
           pained as Theon hacks repeatedly at Rodrik, before 
           resorting to kicking Rodrik's head away from his mutilated 
           neck. Bran and Rickon sob and wail. Theon looks up at the 
           crowd, breathing heavily from the effort.

                   Ghost is different.  
                          QHORIN  
                   So you think. Wild creatures have their 
                   own rules, their own reasons. And 
                   you’ll never know them. Now the 
                   wildlings we’re looking for sleep 
                   during the day and hunt at night.  
                          JON  
                   I thought you said you couldn’t know a 
                   wild thing.  
                          QHORIN  
                   I said you can’t. They find a nice cave 
                   to hide in while the sun’s up, then do 
                   their killing when it’s dark.

                          JON  
                   We could do the same.  
                          QHORIN  
                   No, we couldn’t. This is their country. 
                   They know where to walk, where not to 
                   walk. I’ve lost good men who fell into 
                   a crevasse they didn’t see ‘til they

                   you only have one thing to give in 
                   return. Your life.

           Qhorin puts his hand on Jon’s shoulder, stopping him.  
                          QHORIN  
                   I don’t want you to be glad about it. I 
                   want you to curse and fight ‘til your 
                   heart’s done pumping. And know this, 
                   boy. Your death will be a gift for them 
                   south of the Wall. They’ll never know 
                   what you’ve done. They’ll never know 
                   how you died. They won’t even know your 
                   damn name. But they’ll be alive because 
                   some nameless bastard north of the Wall 
                   gave his life for theirs. Now. Do you

                   You’re even dumber than you look. It’s 
                   just words, boy, to keep us a little 
                   warmer in the night. Make us feel like

                       (LAUGH) Come on. We’ve got to find 
                       these goat fuckers before night falls

              Arya enters to refill the glasses of the men at the table. 
              Tywin is holding a parchment, and is in the process of 
              upbraiding Ser Amory Lorch. 
                                 TYWIN  
                       Can you read?

                       Can. You. Read? This letter detailing 
                       our infantry movements was meant for 
                       Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was 
                       sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.

              Tywin ignores him.

              Tywin pauses as Arya fetches the correct book without his 
              guidance. 
                                 TYWIN

                          TYWIN  
                   To whom does House Dormand owe 
                   allegiance?  
                          AMORY LORCH  
                   My lord, I...

                   To the Starks of Winterfell. Who have 
                   twenty thousand men. And my son. I 
                   judged you might be good for something 
                   more than brutalizing peasants. I see I 
                   overestimated you. If you ever put my 
                   son’s life at risk again, I'll... 
                    
           He doesn’t have to finish. Lorch gets it.  
      01:13:55      
                          TYWIN  
                   Leave us.  
                    
           Lorch rises and leaves the room. Tywin scowls.  
                          TYWIN  
                   Put the book away, girl. Maybe you 
                   should devise our next battle plan 
                   while you’re at it.  
                    
           Arya picks up the book nervously, returning it to its 
           place. Only when she turns away does she allow herself a 
           grin. A guard enters the chamber. 
                          GUARD

                   Give us the room.  
                    
           The officers go. Arya walks away from the table, trying to 
           be inconspicuous.

           Arya stops, returning to the table as Littlefinger enters. 
                          LITTLEFINGER  
                   Lord Tywin.  
                    
           Arya tries desperately to avoid Littlefinger's gaze as she 
           clears flagons from the table. 
                          TYWIN  
                   Baelish. Wine?  
                          LITTLEFINGER  
                   Thank you.  
      01:14:55      
                    
           Arya grabs her pitcher and heads toward the table, head 
           down.    
                          TYWIN  
                   What news from the capital?  
                          LITTLEFINGER  
                   I traveled here directly from Renly 
                   Baratheon’s camp.  
                          TYWIN  
                   Ah, the late “King” Renly. Rather a 
                   short reign. Murdered by a woman, I 
                   hear.  
                    
           Arya begins to pour a drink for Littlefinger, trying to 
           avoid his eye. 
                          LITTLEFINGER  
                   So they say. There has been talk of 
                   other forces at work. Dark forces.  
                    
           Tywin stops Arya as she beings to walk away, offering his 
           own goblet. 
                          TYWIN 
                   Here. (LAUGH) Men love to blame demons 
                   when their grand plans unravel.

           Arya pours Tywin's drink, then tries to busy herself far 
           away from the two men. 
                          LITTLEFINGER  
                   It is my belief that a moment of chaos 
                   affords opportunities lost soon after.  
                          TYWIN  
                   You say that as if you were the first 
                   man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is 
                   an opportunity. What other brilliant 
                   insights have you brought me today?  
                          LITTLEFINGER  
                   After the Lannisters and the Starks, 
                   the Tyrells command the largest host. 
                   Their lands are the most fertile in the 
                   Seven Kingdoms. Feeding horses and 
                   soldiers… 
                          TYWIN  
                   Yes, yes, yes. 
                          LITTLEFINGER  
                   The Tyrells have not yet declared for 
                   any of the surviving kings. Loras wants 
                   revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly’s 
                   death. And Margaery… 
      01:16:02      
                          TYWIN  
                   Wants to be queen.  
                          LITTLEFINGER  
                   Yes she does.  
                          TYWIN  
                   House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron

                   They did. And perhaps that treason 
                   should be punished. One day. After 
                   Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.  
                    
           Arya freezes.

           Arya moves to fetch the wine. 
                          LITTLEFINGER  
                   If you will allow me to represent your 
                   family’s interests, I believe an 
                   advantageous agreement...

                   The Tyrell host has returned to

                          LITTLEFINGER  
                   They have.  
                    
           Arya spills the wine, aghast at the mistake.

                   Pardon, my lord.

                   It’s only wine.  
                    
           Arya wipes up the spill, desperately trying not to let 
           Littlefinger see her face. He looks at her for a moment. 
                          TYWIN  
                   You would ride there yourself?

                   will be all, girl.

                   What else?

                   On your son Tyrion’s directive I met 
                   with Catelyn Stark.  
                    
           Arya, suddenly interested, begins to walk slower, trying to 
           hear as much as possible before leaving. 
                          TYWIN  
                   Why?  
                          LITTLEFINGER  
                   He had an interesting proposal for her. 
                   Concerning her daughters.

           Qhorin, Jon, and the rangers sneak up to a camp where three 
           wildlings sit around a small fire. Once they are in 
           position, Qhorin gives a hand signal, and Stonesnake fires 
           an arrow into one of the seated figures. Qhorin and Jon 
           rush the others, and Qhorin quickly dispatches his opponent 
           while Jon catches the last wildling before he can take up 
           an axe. As he prepares to kill his opponent, the wildling's 
           hood falls to reveal a woman with bright red hair. Jon 
           glances at Qhorin.

                   a wildling to bite off his tongue

                   she’ll bury it in your face.  
                          YGRITTE  
                   (to Jon)  
                   I gave you my name.  
                          JON  
                   I’m Jon Snow.  
                    
           She glances at the bodies of her dead comrades.  
                          YGRITTE  
                   You ought to burn them you killed.  
                          QHORIN  
                   We’d need a big fire for that. Tell me, 
                   Ygritte, why do you want us to build a 
                   big fire? You have some more friends in 
                   the area?  
                          YGRITTE  
                   Burn them. Or maybe you’ll need those 
                   swords again.

                   Our boy here’s already killed one dead   
                   man. He can do it again if he has to. 
                   What waits beyond the pass?  
                          YGRITTE  
                   The free folk.  
                          QHORIN  
                   How many?  
                          YGRITTE  
                   Hundreds and thousands. More than 
                   you've ever seen, crow.  
                          QHORIN  
                   Why come to the mountains? What’s in 
                   the Frostfangs your king could want?  
                    
           Ygritte eyes Jon silently. 
                          QHORIN  
                   Do you mean to march on the Wall?  
                    
           Qhorin reaches out and touches her face, almost gently. 
                          QHORIN  
                   Do you know who I am, girl?  
                          YGRITTE  
                   Qhorin Halfhand.  
                          QHORIN  
                   Tell me true. If your people captured 
                   me, would they take me prisoner?  
                          YGRITTE  
                   They’d take your head off your 
                   shoulders, if they was feeling kind. If 
                   not, they’d kill you slow.

           Qhorin nods.

                   a man to watch her. We can’t let her     
                   go, she’ll bring Mance Rayder’s army 
                   down on us. It needs to be done. Want 
                   me to do it?  
                    
           Qhorin draws his dagger.  
                          JON  
                   No. No, I’ll do it.  
                    
           Qhorin sheathes his dagger. 
                          QHORIN  
                   (to the other men)  
                   Come, brothers. Leave him to it. We’ll 
                   meet you at the top. Don’t take too 
                   long. We’re deep in their country now.  
                    
           Qhorin, Stonesnake and the others file away, leaving Jon 
           very much alone with the doomed young woman. She stares up 
           at him.    
                          YGRITTE  
                   You never killed a woman before, did 
                   you? You don’t need to do it. Mance 
                   would take you, I know he would. 
                   There’s secret ways. The crows would 
                   never catch us.  
                          JON  
                   I’m as much a crow as they are.  
                    
           Ygritte sees the resolution in his face. She turns, 
           offering him her neck. 
      01:21:10      
                          YGRITTE  
                   Will you burn me, after?  
                          JON  
                   Can’t. Someone might see the smoke.  
                    
           Ygritte tries to muster her resolve, pulling aside her hood 
           to make for an easier stroke. Jon puts the sword against 
           her neck.

                   come back and haunt you.

                   That’s cold. Go on, be quick about it.  
                    
           Jon hesitates. Ygritte glares at him, then looks away. 
                          YGRITTE  
                   Do it. Bastard. Do it! 
      01:22:00      
                    
           Jon rears back and swings, a mighty blow. He misses her on 
           purpose, his sword ringing against the rock. She looks at 
           Jon, startled, and their eyes meet for a long moment. Then 
           she punches him in the knee, scrambling away down the icy 
           slope. Jon realizes he has no choice but to follow. 
                    
           EXT. NORTH OF THE WALL - NORTHERN HILLS - DUSK. 
                    
           Ygritte bolts across the icy rocks, with Jon in hot 
           pursuit. It seems hopeless, until he sees an angle to cut 
           her off. He races along a ridge, then slides down the slope 
           and tackles her. They roll across the snow. Jon comes out 
           on top. He draws his dagger.  
      01:23:14      
                          YGRITTE  
                   You can’t do it. We both know it.  
                    
           Jon flips her on her back, aiming the dagger at her throat. 
                          YGRITTE  
                   The sun’s going down, Jon Snow. And 
                   your friends are nowhere close.  
                          JON  
                   I’ll find them.  
                          YGRITTE  
                   Call for them. Go on. Call loudly.  
                    
           Jon looks around, realizing Ygritte must have people 
           nearby.

           Myrcella sits in a skiff, being rowed toward a distant 
           ship. Ashore, a crowd of people watches the High Septon 
           intoning a blessing for her journey. 
                          HIGH SEPTON (O.S.) 
                   May the Seven guide the princess on her 
                   journey. May the Mother give her 
                   health, may the Crone give her wisdom, 
                   may the Warrior give her courage.  
                    
           As the High Septon drones on Cersei watches, torn between 
           anguish at sending off her only daughter and fury at same. 
           Tyrion stands next to her. 
      01:23:59      
                          CERSEI  
                   One day I pray you love someone. I pray 
                   you love her so much, when you close 
                   your eyes you see her face. I want that 
                   for you. I want you to know what it’s 
                   like to love someone, to truly love 
                   someone, before I take her from you.  
                    
           Tyrion looks wordlessly at his sister, then walks away. In 
           the crowd, Tommen is crying. A handmaiden dabs at his tears 
           while Joffrey looks on, disgusted. Sansa stands between 
           them.    
                          JOFFREY  
                   You sound like a little cat, mewling 
                   for his mother. Princes don’t cry.

           The guard hustles Tommen and his handmaiden away as the

           Joffrey beings to look nervous. Suddenly, a clod of horse 
           dung flies out of the crowd, hitting him in the face. The 
           gold cloaks draw their swords. 
                          JOFFREY  
                   Who threw that? I want the man who 
                   threw that! Find who did that and bring 
                   him to me!  
                    
           The gold cloaks shove their way into the crowd, which

                                           “The Old Gods and the New” 
           A man in the crowd fells a guard with a mighty blow, and  
           the melee begins. Fights break out all around the entourage 
           as the guards and gold cloaks attempt to protect Joffrey 
           and his family. Cersei looks at Tyrion, frightened. 
      01:26:01      
                          TYRION 
                   Move! Move! 
                          GUARD 
                   Fall back! 
                    
           The Hound grabs Joffrey around the neck, dragging him away 
           from the crowd, who are screaming for his blood. 
                          JOFFREY  
                   What are you doing? I want these people 
                   executed!  
                          HOUND  
                   And they want the same for you.  
                    
           The Hound drags Joffrey through the melee as the gold 
           cloaks begin stabbing wildly into the crowd with their 
           spears. Enraged, the commoners pick up what weapons they 
           can and fight back. The High Septon is swarmed by the mob, 
           and falls screaming. Tyrion watches in horror as the mob 
           holds aloft one of his severed arms, still covered in gold 
           rings and bracelets. 
                          TYRION 
                   Where's Sansa? 
                    
           The ladies scramble for the keep as The Hound and the 
           Kingsguard fight their way to the gate. The Hound slashes 
           at any commoner who gets too close while the guards drag 
           the king to the door of the keep, then inside.  
      01:27:11      
                          GUARD 
                   Keep him safe!  Hold them back! 
                    
           Sansa has been separated from the others, and finds herself 
           confronted by the Leering Man. Panicking, she runs away

           EXT. RED KEEP - JUST WITHIN THE WALLS - DAY.  
                    
           One of the ladies races screaming into the keep, her dress 
           nearly torn off. Joffrey, his terror forgotten, stalks away 
           from the gate, ranting. Tyrion leans against a wall nearby, 
           gasping.   
                          JOFFREY  
                   Traitors! I’ll have all their heads! 
                    
           Tyrion has had enough of Joffrey. 
                          TYRION  
                   Oh, you blind, bloody fool.  
                          JOFFREY  
                   You can’t insult me... 
                          TYRION  
                   We’ve had vicious kings and we’ve had 
                   idiot kings, but I don’t know if we’ve 
                   ever been cursed with a vicious idiot 
                   for a king! 
                          JOFFREY  
                   Y-You can’t... 
                          TYRION

                   They attacked me! 
                          TYRION  
                   They threw a cow pie at you so you 
                   decide to kill them all? They’re 
                   starving, you fool. All because of a 
                   war you started.  
                          JOFFREY  
                   You’re talking to a king!

                   And now I’ve struck a king. Did my hand 
                   fall from my wrist?  
                    
           Tyrion looks around, searching. 
                          TYRION  
                   Where is the Stark girl?  
                          JOFFREY  
                   Let them have her! 
                          TYRION  
                   If she dies, you’ll never get your 
                   Uncle Jaime back. You owe him quite a

           The Leering Man grabs Sansa and tears her dress. Sansa 
           slaps him hard, surprising him and herself. The Leering Man 
           smacks her and Sansa goes down. She begins to crawl away 
           while one of the men tears at her dress. 
                          LEERING MAN 
                   Where you going? 
                    
           He falls on her.

                   You ever been fucked, little girl?  
                    
           Sansa begins to shriek and fight as they pull her back.

           Tyrion looks to Joffrey, who glares at him and stalks away 
           without a word. 
                    
           EXT. ARCADE - OUTSIDE THE RED KEEP - DAY. 
                    
           Sansa fights against the men, but they easily overpower 
           her. She begins to sob as they spread her legs, and the 
           Leering Man fumbles at his britches. Suddenly, a mailed 
           fist reaches down, lifting the Leering Man up and away, 
           then off the ground entirely. The Hound holds the man aloft 
           with one hand and disembowels him with the other. He kills 
           the second would-be rapist with a single strike, then 
           slashes the throat of the last man as he attempts to flee. 
           Sansa watches, in shock. 
      01:29:07      
                          HOUND  
                   You’re all right now, little bird. 
                   You’re all right.  
                    
           He helps her up, then hoists her over his shoulder. 
           Outside, the crowd is in chaos, commoners fighting 
           commoners when they can't find the royals. 
                    
           EXT. RED KEEP - JUST WITHIN THE WALLS - DAY.  
                    
           The Hound carries Sansa inside, his sword smeared with 
           blood. He sets her down. Sansa is dazed, bleeding from her 
           cut. Tyrion walks over, genuinely concerned.  
                          TYRION  
                   Are you hurt, my lady?  
                    
           Sansa shakes her head.

                   The little bird’s bleeding. Someone 
                   take her back to her cage. See to that 
                   cut.  
                    
           Several handmaidens swarm around Sansa, wrap their arms 
           around her, helping her inside.

                   The Spice King is the second wealthiest 
                   man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. 
                   Of course, you could have avoided this 
                   embarrassment if you married the 
                   wealthiest man in Qarth.

                   Forgive me, I had terrible dreams last

                   beauty you are, now that the Red Waste 
                   has been washed off you! I am sorry

                   silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro 
                   Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for 
                   a glorified dock worker like yourself. 
                          XARO 
                   Very true. And yet they say that your 
                   grandfather, who sold pepper off the 
                   back of a wagon, married a lady far 
                   lovelier, and higher born, than 
                   himself.

                   I’m not asking you for the Kingdoms. 
                   I’m asking you for ships. I need to 
                   cross the Narrow Sea. 
                          SPICE KING 
                   I need my ships as well. I use them, 
                   you see, to bring spices from one port 
                   to another.

                   little princess. Unlike you, I do not    
                   have exalted ancestors. I make my 
                   living by trade, and I judge every 
                   trade on its merits. You ask for ships. 
                   You say I shall be repaid triple. I do 
                   not doubt your honesty or your 
                   intentions. But before you repay your 
                   debts, you must seize the Seven

                   powerful allies in Westeros?

                   There are many there that support my

                   I left when I was a baby. 
                          SPICE KING 
                   So, in truth, you have no allies.

                   The people will rise to fight for their

                   cannot make an investment based on 
                   wishes and dreams. Now, if you’ll

                   Yes, we’ve met. A shrewd man. 
                          DANY 
                   For my wedding, he gave me three 
                   petrified dragon eggs. He believed, the 
                   world believed that the ages had turned 
                   them to stone. How many centuries had 
                   it been since dragons roamed the skies? 
                   But I dreamt that if I carried those 
                   eggs into a great fire, they would 
                   hatch. When I stepped into that fire, 
                   my own people thought I was mad. But 
                   when the fire burnt out, I was unhurt, 
                   the Mother of Dragons.

           The Spice King takes a step towards her. 
                          SPICE KING 
                   I admire your passion. 
                   (beat) 
                   But in business, I trust in logic, not 
                   passion. I’m sorry, little princess. 
                    
           He walks up the stairs away from her.

                          DANY 
                   I am not your little princess. I am 
                   Daenerys Stormborn, of the blood of Old 
                   Valyria, and I will take what is mine.

           INT. HARRENHAL - TYWIN’S CHAMBER - DAY.          
                    
           Arya clears away the table. As she does so, she notices a 
           note lying next to a plate with Robb's name on it. As she 
           tries to read it, Tywin approaches her from behind. 
                          TYWIN  
                   Who taught you to read?  
                    
           She jumps, startled, feeling caught.  
                          ARYA  
                   My father, my lord.  
                          TYWIN  
                   I taught my son Jaime to read. Maester 
                   came to me one day, told me he wasn’t 
                   learning. Couldn't make sense of the 
                   letters, he reversed them in his head. 
                   The maester said he had heard tell of 
                   this affliction, and that we simply 
                   must accept it. (LAUGH) After that, I 
                   sat Jaime down for four hours every day 
                   until he learned. He hated me for it, 
                   for a time. For a long time. But he 
                   learned. Hmm. 
      01:35:24      
                    
           Arya picks up a goblet. 
                          TYWIN  
                   Where is your father? Is he alive?  
                    
           She shakes her head.  
                          TYWIN  
                   Who was he?  
                          ARYA  
                   A stone mason.  
                          TYWIN  
                   A stone mason who could read. Hmm.

                   Quite a man. What killed him?

                   Loyalty.  
                          TYWIN  
                   You’re a sharp little thing, aren’t 
                   you?  
                          ARYA  
                   Did... 
                    
           She averts her eyes.  
                          ARYA  
                   Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn’t ask 
                   questions.  
                          TYWIN  
                   No. But you’ve already begun.

                          ARYA  
                   Did you know your father, my lord?  
                          TYWIN  
                   I did. I grew up with him. I watched 
                   him grow old. He loved us. He was a 
                   good man.  
                    
           Tywin takes a seat facing away from Arya. She takes the 
           opportunity to grab the scroll. 
                          TYWIN  
                   But a weak man. A weak man who nearly 
                   destroyed our House and name. I'm cold. 
                          ARYA  
                   I’ll fetch more wood for the fire, my 
                   lord.  
                    
           He looks at her, nods, and looks away.

           Arya reads the scroll. It contains the details of Tywin's 
           troop movements against Robb. She stands and begins to run.

           As Arya runs down a corridor, she’s stopped by Ser Amory

           Lorch eyes her suspiciously, then snatches the parchment

           She finally loses him, but realizes he's going to tell 
           Tywin about her. She runs for a nearby guard post and grabs 
           the arm of the red-haired man standing there, but recoils 
           when she doesn't recognize him. She then finds the man

           Lorch bursts in. Before he can get out a single word, he 
           falls face-forward onto the floor. Tywin steps over to his 
           body, noticing a tiny poison dart lodged in his neck.

           EXT. WESTERLANDS - STARK CAMP - DAY. 
                    
           Robb moves through the camp, greeting and interacting with 
           his men. He clearly has affection for his soldiers, and 
           they for him. After examining a captured Lannister helmet, 
           he sees a young woman sitting alone, writing a letter. Robb 
           approaches her. 
                          ROBB  
                   Lady Talisa.  
                          TALISA  
                   Your Grace. I’m not sure that I’m a 
                   “Lady.” Westerosi customs are still a 
                   bit foreign to me.  
                          ROBB  
                   It’s hard to keep all the rules 
                   straight. But if I remember my lessons, 
                   a woman of noble birth is always called 
                   a Lady. Unless she’s a queen. Or a 
                   princess. I could find someone who 
                   knows.  
                          TALISA  
                   Why are you so sure I’m of noble birth?  
                          ROBB  
                   Because it’s obvious.  
                          TALISA  
                   What if I told you my father sold lace 
                   on the Long Bridge? And my mother and 
                   brother and I lived with him above our 
                   shop?  
                    
           A long beat.  
                          ROBB  
                   I’d call you a liar.

                   Not very noble to accuse a lady of 
                   dishonesty.  
                    
           They stare at each other for a moment, and she grins. 
                          TALISA  
                   I always thought I was a brilliant 
                   liar.  
                          ROBB  
                   Better at amputations, I’m afraid.  
                    
           Talisa looks away at his poor attempt at humor. Robb 
           struggles for something else to say to her. 
                          ROBB  
                   Quite a pretty spot.  
                    
           Talisa glances around.  
                          TALISA  
                   Will we be here long?  
                          ROBB  
                   I couldn’t really discuss troop 
                   movements with you.  
                          TALISA  
                   I’m not a spy.  
                          ROBB  
                   Of course, a spy would deny being a 
                   spy.  
                          TALISA  
                   You’re right. You’ve found me out. I’m 
                   writing a letter to the  
                   Lannisters. “The Young Wolf is on the 
                   move.”  
                    
           Robb smiles.

           As Robb stumbles toward an invitation, Talisa sees someone 
           approaching from behind Robb.  
                          ROBB

           Catelyn and Brienne approach from behind Robb. 
                          CATELYN  
                   Robb? 
                          ROBB  
                   Mother.  
                    
           Robb goes to embrace his mother, who looks at Talisa. 
                          ROBB  
                   Mother, this is... Lady Talisa. She's 
                   been helping with the wounded. She’s 
                   been very... helpful.  
                          CATELYN  
                   Lady Talisa.

           A fairly pointed question.

                   Maegyr.  
                          CATELYN  
                   Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this

                          TALISA  
                   An uncommon name here. An old name in 
                   Volantis. Excuse me, my lady, Your

           She goes off. Robb watches her. Cat notices this.

           Jon and Ygritte walk across a rocky landscape, the last of 
           the light leaving the sky. Jon halts, looking lost. 
                          YGRITTE 
                   Your brothers desert you? I can tell 
                   you which way to go. 
                          JON 
                   We’ll stop here. Too dark to go any 
                   farther today. 
                          YGRITTE 
                   Here? There's no shelter here. 
                          JON 
                   There’s no shelter anywhere. 
                          YGRITTE 
                   There is, if you know where to look. 
                    
           Jon begins tying Ygritte up.

                          YGRITTE 
                   The cold could kill us both. If we 
                   light a fire, then... 
                          JON

                   Have it your way. 
                    
           Jon finishes tying her legs, then lowers her to the ground 
           like a parcel. He begins to walk away to find his own spot.

                   Bet you freeze to death before I do. 
                   Bet your life. 
                    
           Jon looks over his shoulder at her. He walks back to her, 
           curling up against her. 
                          YGRITTE 
                   Think they’re out looking for you?

           Ygritte lies there for a moment, then a tiny smile crosses 
           her face. She begins to move against Jon. 
                          JON 
                   Stop moving.

                   it is true.  
                          ROBB  
                   Why? Why would Theon... 
                          BOLTON  
                   Because the Greyjoys are treasonous 
                   whores.  
                          ROBB  
                   My brothers? 
                          BOLTON  
                   We’ve heard nothing of them. But Rodrik 
                   Cassel is dead.  
                    
           Catelyn looks at him, shocked.

                   There’s still a war to win, Your Grace.

                   How can I call myself king if I can’t

                   to follow me if I can’t... 
                          BOLTON  
                   You are a king. And that means you 
                   don’t have to do everything yourself.  
                          CATELYN  
                   Let me go and talk to Theon.  
                          ROBB  
                   There will be no talk. He will die for

                   Theon holds the castle with a skeleton 
                   crew. Let me send word to my bastard at 
                   the Dreadfort. He can raise a few 
                   hundred men and retake Winterfell 
                   before the new moon. We have the 
                   Lannisters on the run. If you march all 
                   the way back north now, you’ll lose 
                   what you’ve gained. My boy would be 
                   honored to bring you Prince Theon’s 
                   head.

                   Tell your son, Bran and Rickon’s safety 
                   is paramount. And Theon, I want him 
                   brought to me alive. I want to look him 
                   in the eye and ask him why.  
                   (beat)  
                   And then I’ll take his head myself.

           She moves in close, embracing the man. They kiss, while she 
           deftly draws his dagger and slits his throat. As he falls, 
           she signals behind her. Rickon emerges from the darkness,

                   When I came to this city, I had 
                   nothing. Truly, nothing. I slept by the 
                   docks. And when I could find work 
                   loading the ships, I would eat. If not, 
                   I dreamed of food. Today, I am the 
                   richest man in Qarth. Do you think the 
                   path from poverty to wealth is always 
                   pure and honorable? I have done many 
                   things, khaleesi, that a righteous man
