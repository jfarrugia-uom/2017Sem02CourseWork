              The room has stone statues of gods: a woman, a man with a lion's head. 
           
                            
              ( water dripping )

              The Waif walks through the room carrying a bucket. Arya Stark sweeps the floor. Jaqen 
              H'Ghar, sitting by the pool at the center of the room, scoops a cup of water from the 
              pool and offers it to a man kneeling at the pool's edge. Arya watches.

       01:03:29:06          
                            
               The man walks away and kneels down in front of a statue.  Arya approaches Jaqen. 
           
                             ARYA 
                     I've been sweeping this floor for days.

                             ARYA 
                     I didn't come here to sweep floors.

              Jaqen rises.

              Jaqen turns and begins to walk away. Arya follows him. 
           
       01:03:57:09          
                             ARYA 
                         I want to serve. 
           
                            
              Jaqen stops and looks at her.

                             ARYA 
                     Which one's the Many-Faced God? 
           
                            
              Arya looks around at the statues. 
           
       01:04:13:01          
                             ARYA

                           JAQEN 
                       And all men know his gift. 
           
                            
              Jaqen walks away, while Arya stands watching. Two acolytes enter and lift the body of 
              the man, who is now lying dead. They carry it away. Arya speaks to the Waif. 
           
       01:05:03:01          
                             ARYA 
                       Where are they taking him? 
           
                            
              The Waif walks away without answering. Arya gazes after her.

       01:06:47:24          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                         You're very sweet. 
           
       01:06:49:15          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                     The sweetest king who ever lived. 
           
       01:06:52:26          
                            
                          TOMMEN 
                      This is all I want to do all day, 
           
       01:06:56:07          
                            
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                      every day, for the rest of my life. 
           
       01:06:58:02          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                     ( laughs ) Wouldn't that be glorious? 
           
                            
              Tommen leans over to kiss Margaery. 
           
       01:07:02:06          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                      Shouldn't we rest a little while? 
           
       01:07:03:27          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                  Just to catch our breath? There's no rush, is there? 
           
                            
              Tommen draws back. 
                            
       01:07:06:14          
                            
                          TOMMEN 
                         Of course not. 
           
       01:07:08:28          
                            
                          TOMMEN 
                         Are you hungry? 
       01:07:10:17 
                            
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
               Should I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice? 
           
       01:07:12:28          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                          No, I'm fine. 
           
       01:07:14:25          
                            
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                       I just want you all to myself. 
           
       01:07:18:00          
                            
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                    I want to know everything there is to know 
           
       01:07:20:11          
                            
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                    about King Tommen, First of His Name. 
           
                            
       01:07:23:16 
                            
                          TOMMEN 
                         King Tommen. 
           
       01:07:25:20          
                            
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                       Still sounds strange to me. 
           
       01:07:28:19          
                            
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                   Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you? 
           
       01:07:32:06          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                          So strange. 
           
       01:07:34:08          
                            
                        MARGAERY, TOMMEN 
                          Husband. 
                           Wife. 
           
                            
       01:07:36:06          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                          ( laughs ) 
           
       01:07:39:11          
                            
                          TOMMEN 
                       Sometimes it feels odd. 
           
       01:07:41:23          
                            
                          TOMMEN 
                          I'm the king, 
           
       01:07:43:18          
                            
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                  I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, 
           
                            
                            
                            
       01:07:47:19 
                            
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                     and it's all because my brother died. 
           
       01:07:50:21          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                          I understand. 
           
       01:07:53:00          
                            
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                  But it's not your fault. You know that, don't you? 
           
       01:07:56:10          
                            
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                        You mustn't feel guilty. 
           
       01:07:59:12          
                            
                          TOMMEN 
                         I don't feel guilty. 
           
       01:08:01:26          
                            
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                         That's what's odd. 
           
       01:08:06:21          
                            
              Tommen sits up. 
                            
                            
                          TOMMEN 
                        Do you like to sail? 
           
       01:08:08:04          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                          I love to sail. 
           
       01:08:10:06          
                            
                          TOMMEN 
                          I do, too. 
           
       01:08:12:15          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                   I think we're going to be very happy, you and I. 
           
                            
       01:08:15:17 
                            
                          TOMMEN 
                          I do, too. 
           
       01:08:18:01          
                            
              Margaery kisses Tommen's cheek. 
           
                            
              ( kisses ) 
                            
                            
              Margaery puts on her robe and stands. 
           
       01:08:20:25          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                   Living in a tower so high it touches the clouds. 
           
       01:08:26:13          
                            
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                 Of course, my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. 
           
       01:08:29:07          
                            
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                    The capital's not for everyone, I suppose. 
           
       01:08:33:27          
                            
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                      Does your mother like it here? 
           
                            
              Margaery pours a glass of wine. 
           
       01:08:36:27          
                            
                          TOMMEN 
                         I don't think so. 
           
       01:08:39:00          
                            
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                  She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing. 
           
       01:08:43:10          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                  It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. 
           
                            
                            
       01:08:46:11 
                            
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                       A lioness guarding her cub. 
           
       01:08:49:03          
                            
                          TOMMEN 
                       Well, but I'm a man now. 
           
       01:08:54:19          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                           You are. 
           
       01:08:57:27          
                            
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                          And the king. 
           
                            
              Margaery offers Tommen the glass of wine, bowing to him. 
           
       01:09:01:19          
                            
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                     But you'll always be her baby boy. 
           
       01:09:04:19          
                            
              Tommen drinks. 
                            
                            
                        TOMMEN, MARGAERY 
                          I suppose. 
                          I adore her. 
           
       01:09:07:26          
                            
                          MARGAERY 
                  She's always been so generous with me, so kind. 
           
                            
       01:09:12:06          
                            
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                     And the horrors she's had to endure-- 
           
       01:09:14:03          
                            
              Margaery sits and begins brushing her hair. 
           
                            
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                  losing her husband, her eldest child, and her father. 
           
       01:09:17:26          
                            
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                    It's no wonder she's so protective of you. 
           
       01:09:20:16

              Tommen and Cersei are walking arm in arm. Guards walk at a distance behind them.

                   The first days of marriage are often so blissful.

              EXT. MOAT CAILIN - DAY 
                            
                            
              Sansa Stark and Littlefinger ride horseback, followed by guards. They come to a stop. 
              Sansa and Littlefinger are seen walking; he holds her hand. They look down at Moat 
              Cailin. 
           
                            
                           SANSA 
                        That's Moat Cailin.

                         LITTLEFINGER 
                       Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it?

                       You've been here before?

                           SANSA 
                     On our way down to King's Landing 
                     
       01:15:40:17          
                            
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                       with my father and Arya.

                           SANSA 
                       Where are you taking me? 
                     
       01:15:45:03          
                            
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                           Home.

                      The Boltons have Winterfell. 
              Littlefinger nods.

                           SANSA 
                    Your marriage proposal, it wasn't for you. 
                                       
       01:15:57:18                     
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                            No.

                     Roose Bolton murdered my brother. 
                                       
       01:16:02:18                     
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                        He betrayed my family. 
                                       
                                       
       01:16:04:12                     
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                           He did. 
                                       
       01:16:05:27                     
                           SANSA 
                       He serves the Lannisters. 
                                       
       01:16:07:21                     
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                          For now. 
                                       
       01:16:09:10                     
                        SANSA, LITTLEFINGER 
                          I won't go. 
                       Winterfell is your home. 
           
       01:16:11:26          
                             
                        SANSA, LITTLEFINGER 
                         Not anymore. 
                           Always. 
           
       01:16:14:06                     
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                  You're a Stark. Dying your hair doesn't change that. 
                                       
       01:16:17:09                     
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
               You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. 
                                       
       01:16:21:25                     
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                       Your place is in the North. 
                                       
       01:16:23:18                     
                           SANSA 
                     I can't marry him. You can't make me. 
                                       
       01:16:25:20                     
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                       He is a traitor. A murderer! 
                                       
       01:16:27:29                     
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                     You're not marrying Roose Bolton. 
                                       
       01:16:30:00                     
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                   No, you'll be marrying his son and heir Ramsay. 
                                       
       01:16:33:09                     
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                   One day he'll be Warden of the North and you-- 
                                       
       01:16:35:11  
                            
              Sansa shakes her head, looking upset. 
           
                            
                        SANSA, LITTLEFINGER 
                            No. 
                           Sansa. 
                                       
       01:16:36:19                     
                           SANSA 
                   No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. 
                                       
       01:16:39:11                     
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                     I will die before I have to go there. 
           
       01:16:41:15          
                            
              Littlefinger takes Sansa by the shoulders. 
           
                            
                            
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                      I won't force you to do anything. 
                                       
                                       
       01:16:44:21                     
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                  Don't you know by now how much I care for you? 
                                       
       01:16:48:07                     
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                   Say the word and we turn the horses around, 
                                       
       01:16:50:01                     
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                       but listen to me. Listen. 
           
       01:16:52:19          
                            
              Littlefinger stands close to Sansa, speaking intently. 
           
                            
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                      You've been running all your life. 
                     
       01:16:55:25          
                            
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                  Terrible things happen to your family and you weep. 
                     
       01:16:58:20          
                            
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                 You sit alone in a darkened room mourning their fates. 
                     
       01:17:02:09          
                            
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
             You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. 
                     
       01:17:06:10          
                            
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                    Stop being a bystander. Do you hear me? 
                     
       01:17:08:28          
                            
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                          Stop running. 
           
       01:17:15:14          
                            
              Littlefinger places a hand to Sansa's cheek. 
           
                            
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                      There's no justice in the world. 
                                       
       01:17:17:27                     
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                        Not unless we make it. 
                                       
       01:17:21:21                     
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                        You loved your family. 
                                       
       01:17:24:28                     
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                         Avenge them. 
              Sansa begins to cry. Littlefinger kisses her forehead, then walks away. Littlefinger is 
              seen on his horse as Sansa stands near the moat. Then she turns and joins him. She 
              mounts her horse and rides off. 
           
       01:18:07:24          
                            
              ( horse neighs ) 
                            
                            
              Littlefinger smiles. 
                            
       01:18:09:09          
                             MAN 
                          Banners! 
           
              Littlefinger and the soldiers ride. 
           
       01:18:27:27          
                            
              EXT. HILL OVERLOOKING MOAT CAILIN - DAY 
           
                            
              Brienne and Podrick Payne are on horseback, looking down at Moat Cailin. 
           
                            
                          PODRICK 
                      How do we get through there? 
           
                            
       01:18:29:14 
                            
                          BRIENNE 
                          We don't. 
           
       01:18:30:28          
                            
                          BRIENNE 
                         We go around. 
       01:18:32:27 
                            
                          PODRICK 
                      Takes us miles out of the way. 
           
       01:18:35:07          
                            
                          PODRICK 
                       We'll lose sight of them.

                          BRIENNE 
                         Doesn't matter. 
           
       01:18:38:02          
                            
                          BRIENNE 
                       I know where they're going. 
              Brienne rides away. 
                            
       01:18:43:20          
                            
              EXT. NORTHERN FIELD - DAY 
                            
                            
              Podrick's hands are seen cleaning a boot. 
           
                            
                          BRIENNE 
                    Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? 
              Brienne sits near Podrick. He shakes his head. 
           
       01:18:50:10          
                            
                          BRIENNE 
                    How did you end up squiring for the Imp? 
           
       01:18:52:15          
                            
                          PODRICK 
                       He hates that nickname. 
                     
                            
                            
       01:18:54:12   
                            
                          BRIENNE 
                   Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he? 
              She holds out her hand and Podrick gives her the boot. 
           
       01:19:01:13          
                            
                          PODRICK 
                    I squired for a knight named Ser Lorimer 
                     
       01:19:03:16          
                            
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                      during the War of the Five Kings. 
                     
       01:19:05:09          
                            
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                    One night he had a bit too much to drink 
                                       
       01:19:08:11                     
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                   and he was famished, so he borrowed a ham. 
                                       
       01:19:10:28                     
                          BRIENNE 
                         He borrowed it? 
                                       
       01:19:12:18                     
                          PODRICK 
                         He wasn't a thief. 
                                       
       01:19:13:27                     
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                  He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. 
                                       
       01:19:16:00                     
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                         I was drunk, too. 
                                       
       01:19:18:01                     
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                       He gave me half the ham. 
                                       
                                       
       01:19:21:18                     
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                 Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out 
                                       
       01:19:25:18                     
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                  under a wagon with the hambone still in his hand. 
                                       
       01:19:29:23                     
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                      They hanged him that afternoon. 
                                       
       01:19:32:22                     
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                      They tied the noose for me, too, 
                                       
       01:19:34:08                     
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                  but Lord Tywin heard  my family name was Payne, 
       01:19:37:12                     
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                        so he pardoned me 
                                       
       01:19:38:28                     
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                  and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son. 
                                       
       01:19:41:23                     
                          BRIENNE 
                      As punishment for both of you. 
                                       
       01:19:44:23                     
                          PODRICK 
                       It didn't seem that way. 
                                       
       01:19:46:16                     
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                    Lord Tyrion was always very good to me. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
       01:19:48:18                     
                          BRIENNE 
                   Yes, all your lords have been very kind to you. 
              Brienne stands and begins to walk away. 
           
       01:19:50:26          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                         All except me. 
                                       
       01:19:52:15                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                   Sorry you had to squire for such a nasty person. 
                                       
       01:19:55:05                     
                          PODRICK 
                  I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. 
              Brienne stops to listen. 
                            
       01:19:58:06          
                            
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                        You beat the Hound. 
                     
       01:20:00:23          
                            
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                       I'm proud to be your squire. 
           
       01:20:07:17          
                            
                          BRIENNE 
                     I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you. 
                     
       01:20:10:06          
                            
                          PODRICK 
                  If you didn't snap at me, I wouldn't learn anything. 
           
       01:20:16:15          
                            
              Brienne turns to face him. 
           
                            
                          BRIENNE 
                      You want to be a knight, Pod? 
                     
                            
                            
       01:20:18:24   
                            
                          PODRICK 
                           Yes. 
                     
       01:20:20:18          
                            
                          BRIENNE 
                 Starting tomorrow, we'll train with a sword twice a day. 
                     
       01:20:23:14          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
              Before we ride in the morning and after you make camp in the evening. 
              Brienne walks back and sits next to Podrick. 
           
       01:20:27:03          
                            
                        BRIENNE, PODRICK 
                  And I'm going to show you how to ride properly. 
                          Thank you. 
           
       01:20:29:29          
                            
                          BRIENNE 
                  I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight. 
                                       
       01:20:32:19                     
                          PODRICK 
                      I suppose that's more important. 
           
       01:20:47:02          
                            
              Podrick bends and lights a fire. He stands and begins removing Brienne's armor. 
           
                            
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                  You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard 
           
       01:20:50:10                     
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                     to Renly Baratheon, weren't you? 
                                       
       01:20:52:19                     
                          BRIENNE 
                           I was. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
       01:20:54:15                     
                          PODRICK 
                     Lord Tyrion said he was a good man. 
                                       
       01:20:58:27                     
                          BRIENNE 
                           He was. 
                                       
       01:21:01:28                     
                          PODRICK 
                     How did you end up serving Renly? 
                                       
       01:21:10:08                     
                          BRIENNE 
                    When I was a girl, my father held a ball. 
                                       
       01:21:13:02                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
              I'm his only living child, so he wanted to make a good match for me. 
           
       01:21:16:24          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                    He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. 
                                       
       01:21:19:16                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                 I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. 
                                       
       01:21:25:17                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                        And it was wonderful. 
                                       
       01:21:29:20                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                  None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. 
                                       
       01:21:34:08                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                   They shoved each other and threatened to duel 
                                       
                                       
                                       
       01:21:36:22                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                   when they thought it was their turn to dance. 
                                       
       01:21:40:13                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                       They whispered in my ear 
                                       
       01:21:42:12                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
               how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. 
                                       
       01:21:47:24                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                   My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. 
                                       
       01:21:52:25                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                       I had never been so happy. 
                                       
       01:21:58:03                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                     Till I saw a few of the boys snickering. 
              Podrick listens with a serious expression. 
           
       01:22:02:22          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                     And then they all started to laugh. 
                                       
       01:22:04:15                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                   They couldn't keep the game going any longer. 
                                       
       01:22:07:09                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                       They were toying with me. 
                                       
       01:22:10:19                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                     "Brienne the Beauty" they called me. 
                                       
                                       
       01:22:12:24                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                          Great joke. 
                                       
       01:22:15:19                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                    And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. 
                                       
       01:22:20:11                     
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                       A great lumbering beast. 
           
       01:22:27:13          
                            
              Brienne gazes ahead as she speaks. 
           
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                        I tried to run away, 
                     
       01:22:29:02          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                    but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. 
                     
       01:22:32:11          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                   "Don't let them see your tears," he told me. 
                     
       01:22:35:13          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                       "They're nasty little shits 
                     
       01:22:37:10          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                   and nasty little shits aren't worth crying over." 
                     
       01:22:41:12          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
               He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. 
              Podrick smiles. Brienne smiles back. 
           
                            
                            
                            
       01:22:45:28 
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                     Renly was the king's brother after all. 
                     
       01:22:50:14          
                            
                          PODRICK 
                         But wasn't he...? 
                     
       01:22:54:05          
                            
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                       Lord Tyrion said he was... 
           
       01:22:57:15          
                            
              Brienne speaks impatiently. 
                            
                            
                          BRIENNE 
                    Yes, Pod, he liked men. I'm not an idiot. 
                     
       01:23:00:26          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                     He didn't love me. He didn't want me. 
           
       01:23:02:28          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                    He danced with me because he was kind 
                     
       01:23:04:24          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                      and didn't want to see me hurt. 
                     
       01:23:07:09          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                      He saved me from being a joke. 
                     
       01:23:10:12          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                      From that day until his last day. 
           
       01:23:16:17          
                            
              Brienne's voice grows quiet. 
                            
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                     And I couldn't save him in return. 
                     
       01:23:22:14          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
               Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. 
                     
       01:23:28:03          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                      One day I will avenge King Renly. 
                     
       01:23:31:11          
                            
                          PODRICK 
                     But you said a shadow murdered him. 
                     
       01:23:34:09          
                            
                        PODRICK (CONT'D) 
                      How do you fight a shadow? 
                     
       01:23:35:19          
                            
                          BRIENNE 
                   A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. 
                     
       01:23:39:16          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                   I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. 
           
       01:23:46:10          
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                      Stannis is a man, not a shadow. 
           
       01:23:48:23          
                            
              Brienne pokes a stick into the fire. 
           
                            
                        BRIENNE (CONT'D) 
                       And a man can be killed. 
           
       01:23:55:24          
                            
              INT. JON'S CHAMBERS - CASTLE BLACK - DAY 
           
                            
              Olly opens the door and Stannis Baratheon enters the room. Jon Snow, sitting behind 
              his desk, rises. 
           
                            
                         STANNIS, JON 
                         Lord Commander. 
                          Your Grace. 
           
       01:23:58:10          
                            
              Olly stands near the door. Davos Seaworth enters. 
           
                            
                           STANNIS 
                        I'd like to speak alone. 
                     
       01:24:00:02          
                             JON 
                        Olly is my steward now 
                     
       01:24:02:18          
                            
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                     as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. 
                     
       01:24:05:01          
                            
                         JON (CONT'D) 
              I want him to attend my meetings to learn from men with experience. 
                     
       01:24:11:11          
                            
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                      One day he might command. 
                     
       01:24:17:02          
                            
                           STANNIS 
                          Very well. 
              Stannis sits. 
                            
       01:24:18:12          
                            
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                      Have you considered my offer? 
              Jon also sits. 
                            
       01:24:21:17          
                             JON 
                           I have. 
                     
                            
                            
       01:24:23:06   
                            
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                   And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. 
                     
       01:24:26:01          
                            
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                     All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark. 
                     
       01:24:28:27          
                            
                           STANNIS 
                      Say the word and you will be.

                             JON 
                       But I have to refuse you. 
                     
       01:24:35:22          
                            
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                    I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. 
                     
       01:24:38:09          
                            
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                         My place is here. 
           
       01:24:40:10          
                            
                           STANNIS 
                  I'm giving you the chance to avenge your family, 
                                       
       01:24:43:22                     
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                    to take back the castle where you grew up. 
                                       
       01:24:48:08                     
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                         To rule the North. 
       01:24:50:22                     
                           JON 
                      I wish I could fight beside you. 
                                       
       01:24:52:27                     
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                         Believe me, I do. 
                                       
       01:24:55:02                     
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                    But I swore a sacred vow at the godswood. 
                                       
       01:24:58:08                     
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                    I pledged my life to the Night's Watch. 
                                       
       01:25:01:18                     
                           STANNIS 
                     You're as stubborn as your father. 
                                       
       01:25:04:14                     
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                         And as honorable. 
                                       
       01:25:06:06                     
                           JON 
                      I can imagine no higher praise. 
                                       
       01:25:07:29                     
                           STANNIS 
                       I didn't mean it as praise. 
                                       
       01:25:09:21                     
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                      Honor got your father killed. 
                                       
       01:25:12:10                     
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                 But if your mind's made up, I won't try and dissuade you. 
              Stannis rises. Jon also rises. 
                            
       01:25:14:14          
                             JON 
               May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black? 
           
       01:25:17:25          
                            
              Stannis's voice is harsh. 
                            
                            
                           STANNIS 
                      Are you bored of us already? 
                     
       01:25:20:22          
                             JON 
                    You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. 
                     
       01:25:23:07          
                            
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                       We will never forget that. 
                     
       01:25:24:14          
                            
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                      But it's a question of survival. 
                     
       01:25:26:29          
                            
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                  The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men 
                     
       01:25:29:14          
                            
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                    and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. 
                     
       01:25:32:21          
                            
                         JON (CONT'D) 
                         Winter is coming. 
           
       01:25:35:24          
                            
                           STANNIS 
                          I know it. 
                     
       01:25:37:15          
                            
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   We march on Winterfell within the fortnight, 
                     
       01:25:39:20          
                            
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                      before the snows trap us here. 
                     
       01:25:43:01          
                             JON 
                         And the wildlings? 
                     
       01:25:44:16          
                            
                           STANNIS 
                   If they'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. 
                     
       01:25:46:21          
                            
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                       I leave their fate to you. 
                     
       01:25:48:26          
                            
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                  You could execute them. That's the safest course. 
                     
       01:25:56:00          
                            
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                    Or you could see if this Tormund fellow 
                     
       01:25:58:05          
                            
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                 is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. 
       01:26:00:26   
                            
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                    I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch 
                     
       01:26:02:14          
                            
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                     would rather see the wildlings dead. 
                     
       01:26:04:20          
                             JON 
                       Most of the brothers, yes. 
           
       01:26:07:17          
                             JON 
                    There's little love for the free folk here. 
                                       
       01:26:09:24                     
                           STANNIS 
                   You're the Lord Commander. Your decision. 
              Stannis turns.  
                            
                            
       01:26:13:19

              Olly stands at the open door. 
                            
       01:26:15:04          
                            
                           STANNIS 
                    You have many enemies in Castle Black. 
                     
       01:26:16:22          
                            
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                 Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? 
                     
       01:26:21:01          
                            
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. 
           
       01:26:23:13          
                             JON 
                   I heard it was best to keep your enemies close. 
       01:26:26:06 
                            
                           STANNIS 
                   Whoever said that didn't have many enemies. 
           
              Stannis walks out. Davos follows him, then pauses. 
           
       01:26:36:12          
                            
                           DAVOS 
                       He sees something in you. 
                                       
       01:26:39:05                     
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                     Might not be apparent from his tone, 
                                       
       01:26:42:12                     
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                         but it's the truth. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
       01:26:43:27                     
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                        He believes in you. 
                                       
       01:26:45:04                     
                           JON 
                      I'm sorry I disappointed him.

              Davis sits. Olly closes the door. 
           
                            
                           DAVOS 
                      The king is a complicated man, 
              Jon stands, listening. 
                            
       01:26:54:27          
                            
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                 but he wants to do what's right for the Seven Kingdoms. 
                     
       01:26:57:07          
                             JON 
                       As long as he's ruling them. 
       01:26:58:20   
                            
                           DAVOS 
                        He's the one true king. 
                     
       01:27:01:04          
                            
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                     He has a blood right to that throne. 
                     
       01:27:03:08          
                             JON 
                I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms. 
                     
       01:27:06:27          
                            
                           DAVOS 
                         Have you now? 
       01:27:11:12 
                            
              Davos turns and looks at Olly. 
           
                            
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                   How does the Night's Watch vow go again? 
                     
       01:27:14:05          
                            
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                  I'll bet you've got it memorized since you got here. 
                     
       01:27:19:12          
                             OLLY 
                    Night gathers and now my watch begins. 
                     
       01:27:21:21          
                            
                           DAVOS 
                     No, not that bit. The bit at the end. 
                     
       01:27:24:27          
                             OLLY 
                      I am the sword in the darkness, 
                     
       01:27:27:17          
                            
                         OLLY (CONT'D) 
                       the watcher on the walls, 
                     
       01:27:29:12          
                            
                         OLLY (CONT'D) 
                    the shield that guards the realms of men. 
                     
       01:27:31:17          
                            
                          OLLY, DAVOS 
                         I pledge my life-- 
                        Right, that's enough. 
       01:27:34:00 
                            
              Davos turns back to Jon. 
                            
                            
                           DAVOS 
                    The shield that guards the realms of men. 
                                       
       01:27:36:26                     
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                      That's what you swore to be. 
                                       
       01:27:38:07                     
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                      Now, I'm not a learned man, 
                                       
       01:27:40:10                     
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                but the best way to help the most people might not be sitting 
                                       
       01:27:42:22                     
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                    in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. 
                                       
       01:27:44:26                     
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                    It just might mean wading in the muck, 
                                       
       01:27:47:07                     
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                       getting your boots dirty 
                                       
       01:27:48:29                     
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                     and doing what needs to be done. 
           
       01:27:50:28          
                            
              Jon looks annoyed. 
                            
                             JON 
                      And what needs to be done? 
           
       01:27:52:12          
                            
              Davos stands. 
                            
                            
                           DAVOS 
                     As long as the Boltons rule the North, 
                                       
       01:27:54:19                     
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                        the North will suffer. 
                                       
                                       
                                       
       01:27:57:14                     
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                       Just one man's opinion. 
              Davos walks to the door, which Olly opens for him. Jon sits at his desk. 
           
       01:28:06:26

              INT. HOBAW - ARYA'S ROOM - DAY 
           
                            
              Arya's hand can be seen, holding a coin.  
           
                            
              ( door opens ) 
                            
       01:28:28:14          
                            
              Arya sits up on her bed. The Waif is in her room. 
           
                             ARYA 
                        What do you want? 
                     
       01:28:29:29          
                             WAIF 
                         Who are you? 
                     
       01:28:33:20          
                            
                          ARYA, WAIF 
                           What? 
                        You, who walk in here 
                     
       01:28:35:29          
                             WAIF 
                      with a coin you never earned 
                     
       01:28:37:21          
                            
                         WAIF (CONT'D) 
                      whose value you do not respect. 
           
       01:28:45:04          
                            
              The Waif stands in front of Arya. 
           
                            
                         WAIF (CONT'D) 
                         Who are you? 
                                       
       01:28:49:04                     
                           ARYA 
                           No one. 
              The Waif slaps Arya. 
           
       01:28:50:14          
                             ARYA 
                          Ow! Cunt! 
                                       
       01:28:52:23                     
                           WAIF 
                     A lie. A sad little lie. Who are you? 
       01:28:55:03                     
                           ARYA 
                         I told you, I'm no-- 
              The Waif slaps Arya again. 
                            
       01:28:56:27          
                            
              Arya stands. 
                            
                            
                         ARYA (CONT'D) 
                        Do that again, and-- 
           
              The Waif slaps Arya again. Arya falls. 
           
                            
       01:28:59:09          
                             WAIF 
                         Who are you? 
                                       
       01:29:00:28                     
                           ARYA 
                       You're about to find out. 
              Arya moves a cloth on a table to reveal a sword. She is reaching for it when Jaqen 
              speaks. 
           
       01:29:04:07          
                            
                           JAQEN 
                        What are you doing? 
           
       01:29:06:08          
                             WAIF 
                    We were only playing. The Game of Faces. 
           
       01:29:08:28          
                            
                          JAQEN, WAIF 
                         A girl is not ready. 
                          Clearly not. 
       01:29:11:18 
                            
              Arya stands. 
                            
                             ARYA 
                          I am ready! 
                                       
       01:29:14:05                     
                           JAQEN 
                          For what? 
                                       
       01:29:15:21                     
                           ARYA 
                       For whatever you want. 
                                       
       01:29:17:11                     
                         ARYA (CONT'D) 
                     To be a Faceless Man. To be no one. 
                                       
       01:29:24:18                     
                           JAQEN 
                        Whose sword is that? 
                                       
       01:29:27:07                     
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                       It belongs to Arya Stark. 
                                       
       01:29:28:22                     
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                    Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, 
                                       
       01:29:31:06                     
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                       Arya Stark's stolen silver. 
                                       
       01:29:33:03                     
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                     A man wonders how is it that no one 
                                       
       01:29:37:14                     
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                   came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things.

              Arya's hands can be seen, wrapping her things into a bundle. She stands at the end of 
              the dock and throws the bundle into the canal. Next she throws a small bag of money, 
              then a single coin. Finally she picks up her sword. She stands for a long time, holding it 
              and looking unhappy. 
           
                             ARYA 
                           ( sighs ) 
              Arya hides the sword in a large pile of rocks at the edge of the canal.

              Arya is sweeping. She stops to watch two acolytes carry out a penitent's body. Then a 
              hand grasps her shoulder. It is Jaqen. He nods and walks away. Arya follows. They leave 
              the atrium.

              The Waif begins removing the penitent's clothes. Arya helps her. They remove the 
              clothes, and the Waif takes a cloth from a bucket of water and begins to wash the 
              body. 
           
                             ARYA 
                  What do we do with them after we wash them? 
              The Waif looks at her and does not speak. Arya takes another cloth, dips it in the water, 
              and begins washing the body.

                         Enough of that.

                         JON (CONT'D) 
                     That was a command, not an offer. 
                                       
       01:37:42:05

              Slynt stands. His tone is angry. 
           
                            
                           SLYNT 
                    I will not go meekly off to freeze and die. 
                                       
       01:37:53:16

                  Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. 
                                       
       01:37:56:15

       01:38:01:04 
                            
              Jon speaks quietly. 
                            
                             JON 
                     Are you refusing to obey my order? 
                     
       01:38:09:06          
                            
                           SLYNT 
                   You can stick your order up your bastard ass.

                       Take Lord Janos outside. 
              Men begin to stand.  
                            
       01:38:23:29          
                             JON 
                       Olly, bring me my sword. 
              The men approach Slynt. Thorne stands in front of him; then, after a moment, he 
              moves aside.

                  If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken.

                 A young man said I'd find the High Sparrow back here.

                Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world.

                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                 Who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? 
                                       
       01:56:29:25                     
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                        I always pay my debts. 
                                       
       01:56:32:08                     
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                        I'm well known for it. 
              Tyrion looks over to where the woman is sitting on the man's lap. 
           
       01:56:33:23

                             CLEA 
                          You like her. 
                                       
       01:56:41:00                     
                         CLEA (CONT'D) 
                         They all like her. 
                                       
       01:56:42:23                     
                         CLEA (CONT'D) 
                      They all want to fuck a queen. 
                                       
       01:56:44:09                     
                           TYRION 
                    That's because they've never met a queen.

                        You're just saying that. 
                                       
       01:56:47:19                     
                           TYRION 
                      You know how to spot a liar. 
           
       01:56:50:03          
                            
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       If I could pick any girl here, 
                                       
       01:56:52:18                     
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                         I would pick you. 
                                       
       01:56:55:04                     
                           CLEA 
                           Why? 
                                       
       01:56:56:19                     
                           TYRION 
                     Because you have a skeptical mind. 
                                       
       01:57:03:18                     
                           CLEA 
                      All right, then. I'm warning you, 
                                       
       01:57:05:19                     
                         CLEA (CONT'D) 
                     we're going to have to wash you first. 
              Clea stands and takes Tyrion's hand. He does not follow her. 
           
       01:57:08:03          
                            
                         CLEA (CONT'D) 
                          Come on.

                        I'm- I'm sorry, I can't.

                           CLEA 
                      Of course you can. You're shy. 
                                       
       01:57:24:05                     
                           TYRION 
                           I'm not. 
                                       
       01:57:27:22                     
                           CLEA 
                        Have another drink. 
                                       
       01:57:29:07                     
                           TYRION 
                       Gladly, but this I can't do. 
                                       
       01:57:32:08                     
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. 
           
       01:57:35:06          
                            
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                         I hope it passes. 
                                       
       01:57:37:25                     
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                      What will I do in my spare time? 
                                       
       01:57:43:02                     
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       Go for a piss. That's a start. 
              Tyrion drops Clea's hand and leaves. Varys looks around, then stands. 
           
       01:57:53:11

              Tyrion stands urinating into the river. 
           
                            
              ( urinating ) 
                            
           
       01:58:00:12          
                            
              A man walks up behind Tyrion. 
           
                            
              ( mug splashes ) 
                            
       01:58:04:12          
                            
                           TYRION 
                      No need to worry. I was just-- 
                                       
       01:58:06:28                     
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                    Oh, I thought you were someone else. 
                                       
       01:58:11:17                     
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                        Show's almost over. 
                                       
       01:58:13:02                     
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                 I'm sure there are girls inside who'd be happy to oblige. 
           
               
              The man drops a rope around Tyrion's neck and begins to bind him. 
           
       01:58:18:02          
                            
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     You've made some kind of mistake. 
       01:58:19:20                     
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                Why don't you tell me what you think you're doing and then-- 
                                       
       01:58:23:23                     
                           JORAH 
                       I'm taking you to the queen. 
              Jorah lifts Tyrion over his shoulder and walks away. 
           
       01:58:34:17
