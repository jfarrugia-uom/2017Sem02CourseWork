             Lord Hoster’s dead body, with a flag and sword on top of 
             it, lies on a boat.  Robb and Brynden push the boat to the 
             river and walk back up the dock to join Talisa and Catelyn.  
             Edmure walks to the edge of dock with his bow and arrow.  
             He then lights the arrow on fire and fires at the boat but 
             misses.  He tries it again but fails.

             out of his way.  Brynden lights the arrow on fire.

             it to burn.

             INT. RIVERRUN - ROOM - DAY. 
              
             Robb stares out of the window.  Edmure stands behind him. 
                           EDMURE 
                    I encountered a situation with one of 
                    my lieutenants at the Stone Mill... 
             Brynden is in the room with them. 
                           EDMURE (CONT'D) 
                    ...which may have some bearing...

                           BLACKFISH (to Edmure) 
                    Why don't you shut your mouth about 
                    that damned mill? 
                           BLACKFISH (CONT'D - OS) 
                    And don't call him "nephew." 
                           BLACKFISH (CONT'D) 
                    He is your king.

             Brynden walks towards Edmure. 
                           EDMURE (CONT'D) 
                    I meant him no disr... 
       01:04:19      
                           BLACKFISH 
                    You're lucky I'm not your king.  I 
                    wouldn't let you wave your blunders 
                    around like a victory flag.

                    My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog 
                    scurrying back to Casterly Rock with 
                    his tail between his legs.  I think 
                    King Robb understands we're not gonna 
                    win this war if he's the only one 
                    winning any battles.  No, there's glory 
                    enough to go around. 
       01:04:37      
                           ROBB 
                    It's not about glory. 
             Brynden steps away from Edmure. 
                           ROBB (OS) 
                    Your instructions were to wait... 
             Robb moves closer to Emdure. 
                           ROBB (CONT'D) 
                    ...for him to come to you. 
       01:04:43      
                           EDMURE 
                    I seized an opportunity.

                    The Mountain was garrisoned across the 
                    river from it.

                    Of course not. 
                           EDMURE (CONT'D) 
                    We took the fight to him.  He could not 
                    withstand us. 
       01:04:54      
                           ROBB 
                    I wanted to draw the Mountain into the 
                    west, into our country where we could 
                    surround him and kill him.  I wanted 
                    him to chase us, which he would have 
                    done because he is a mad dog without a 
                    strategic thought in his head.  I could 
                    have that head on a spike by now.  
                    Instead, I have a mill.

             Tywin stands besides the chair.  Pycelle, Varys and 
             Littlefinger walk inside the chamber.  Tyrion follows 
             behind them.  Tywin sits on his chair.  Pycelle, Varys and 
             Littlefinger sit on their chair.  Cersei walks inside the 
             room, pauses, lifts a chair and sits beside Tywin.  Tyrion 
             walks towards the table, drags a chair, puts it at the edge 
             of the table in front of Tywin and sits.

                    If I had a proper forge, I could make

             Arya is sitting on a wooden barrel. 
                           THOROS (CONT'D) 
                    It just has to keep the arrows out of 
                    my heart.

                    These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's 
                    daughter.  You're lucky we found you. 
             Arya hops off the wooden barrel and walks away.

             Arya sees the Hound held captive by the soldiers with Anguy 
             walking by his side.

                    Looks like every other shit inn on the 
                    road. 
             Anguy shoves Arya away.

             Anguy steps on the wagon and leads the Hound into it.  The 
             Hound hits his head on the wagon.

             The wagon starts to leave.  Arya turns to Hot Pie who is 
             walking towards her holding a piece of bread.

                    I baked some brown bread for the

                    It often comforts me to think that even 
                    in war's darkest days, in most places 
                    in the world absolutely nothing is 
                    happening.

                    After 30 years of fighting, I don't 
                    think he remembered what started it.  
                    He asked me to stop calling myself 
                    Blackfish.  He said it was an old joke 
                    and it was never funny to begin with.  
                    I told him people had been calling me 
                    Blackfish for so long, they don't 
                    remember my real name.

                    You should all be kissing my feet for 
                    letting you in. 
                           CRASTER (CONT'D) 
                    I'd have turned you all away if I

                    I am.  I got no fear of what's out 
                    there. 
                           CRASTER (OS)

                    you.  The only ones left...

                    All questions have been taken from       
                    them.  They obey, that is all.

                    They will fall on their swords if you 
                    command it.

                    taking you to war.

                    You may go hungry.  You may fall sick.

                    You may be killed.

                    Yes, all men must die.  But we are not 
                    men.

             Ros shows her cleavage to Podrick as she passes the book to 
             him.  Podrick takes the book and puts it on the cart.

                           TYRION (OS)

                    I'm surprised you're surprised.  This 
                    is the safest place... 
             Littlefinger sits and writes at his desk while Tyrion 
             stands in front of him. 
                           LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                    ...in the city. 
       01:35:32      
                           TYRION 
                    Not for bastards. 
       01:35:35      
                           ROS (OS) 
                    That's all of them, my lord. 
       01:35:37      
                           TYRION (OS) 
                    Thank you, my dear.  Pod.  Pod.  Take 
                    them outside. 
                           TYRION (CONT'D) 
                    I'll be there in a moment.

                           PODRICK 
                    Yes, my lord. 
             Podrick pulls the cart out of the room.  Tyrion stares at 
             Ros who is leaving the room.  Littlefinger continue 
             writing.

                    Only my life.  Not all that 
                    significant, I'm afraid. 
       01:36:03      
                           LITTLEFINGER 
                    You should have him knighted. 
       01:36:05      
                           TYRION 
                    If only the Master of Coin had such 
                    power.

                           LITTLEFINGER 
                    If only. 
             Littlefinger puts his quill down and looks at Tyrion. 
                           LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                    I owe you a significant debt.  Our 
                    redheaded friend.  You secured her 
                    release when the queen detained her. 
       01:36:21      
                           TYRION 
                    Oh, that.  Of course.  A simple 
                    misunderstanding. 
       01:36:26      
                           LITTLEFINGER (OS)

                    ...Her Grace believed that you two had 
                    some sort of special relationship.

                           TYRION 
                    We don't.  I did fuck her once.

                           TYRION 
                    But we don't.

                           LITTLEFINGER 
                    I know.  But how would the queen get 
                    that idea? 
       01:36:41      
                           TYRION 
                    Why don't you ask her? 
             Tyrion walks away.  Littlefinger stands up and follows 
             Tyrion. 
                           TYRION (CONT'D) 
                    Any advice for me on my new position? 
       01:36:49

                    Keep a low profile.

             Tyrion stops and turns back to Littlefinger.

                    ...a gold dragon for every time I heard 
                    that joke, I'd be richer than you are.

                    They're only numbers.  Numbers on

                    easy to make them behave. 
             Littlefinger opens the door for Tyrion. 
                           LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                    Trivial even.  You want a real

             Bronn hops off the window and approaches Tyrion. 
                           BRONN (CONT'D) 
                    Tonight, then.  Looks like dull 
                    reading. 
             Podrick walks towards the cart and continues pulling it as 
             he follows Bronn and Tyrion.

             INT. TYRION’S HOUSE - ROOM - DAY. 
              
             Tyrion flips the pages of the book while sitting on his 
             chair. 
                           TYRION 
                    For years, I've heard that Littlefinger 
                    is a magician.  Whenever the crown 
                    needs money, he rubs his hands together 
                    and, poof, mountains of gold. 
       01:39:35      
                           BRONN (OS) 
                    Let me guess. 
             Bronn picks the bottle from a table and uncorks it. 
                           BRONN (CONT'D) 
                    He's not a magician. 
       01:39:37      
                           TYRION 
                    No. 
       01:39:41      
                           BRONN 
                    He's stealing it? 
             Bronn smells the contents of the bottle. 
              
       01:39:42 
                           TYRION 
                    Worse, he's borrowing it. 
             Bronn puts the bottle back on the table and walks towards 
             Tyrion. 
              
       01:39:45

                    We can't afford to pay it back, that's 
                    what's wrong with it. 
             Bronn picks up something from Tyrion’s table. 
                           TYRION (CONT'D) 
                    The crown owes millions to my father.

                           BRONN 
                    Seeing, as it's his grandson's ass on

                    ...I imagine he'll forgive that debt. 
             Bronn puts the thing back on Tyrion’s table.

                    of the world... 
             Bronn walks towards a shelf. 
                           TYRION (CONT'D - OS)

                    money... 
             Bronn puts the thing back on the shelf.  He then walks 
             towards the Tyrion. 
                           TYRION (CONT'D - OS)

                Bronn stands up, grabs Podrick by the arm and makes him sit 
                on a chair.  Tyrion takes the cups and a bottle of liquor 
                at the table.  He then distributes the cup.

                Theon rides the horse through the open field searching for

             Theon ducks to avoid hitting a trunk.  The Lord Torturer 
             riding his horse moves towards Theon and hits him with his
