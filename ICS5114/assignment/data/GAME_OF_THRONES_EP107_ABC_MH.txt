                         Attacking him was stupid. Lannisters don’t

                   One of our men interfered. Speared him

                   It wouldn’t have been clean.
                            TYWIN
                   Clean. You spend too much time worrying
                   about what other people think of you.
                            JAIME
                   I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
                            TYWIN
                   No, that’s what you want people to think of
                   you.
                           JAIME
                   It’s the truth.
                            TYWIN
                   When you hear them whispering “Kingslayer”
                   behind your back, doesn’t it bother you?
                            JAIME
                   Of course, it bothers me.

                   A lion doesn’t concern himself with the
                   opinions of the sheep.I suppose I should
                   be grateful that your vanity got in the way
                   of your recklessness. I’m giving you half
                   of our forces, thirty thousand men. And
                   we’ll bring them to Catelyn Stark’s girlhood
                   home, and remind her that Lannisters pay
                   their debts.

                                    JAIME
                         I didn’t realize you placed such a high
                         value on my brother’s life.
                                    TYWIN
                         He’s a Lannister. He might be the lowest of
                         the Lannisters, but he’s one of us. And
                         every day that he remains a prisoner, the
                         less our name commands respect.
                                    JAIME
                         So the lion does concern himself with the
                         opinions of the sh…
                                    TYWIN
                         No, that’s not an opinion, it’s a fact. If
                         another house can seize one of our own, and
                         hold him captive with impunity, we are no
                         longer a house to be feared.  Your mother’s
                         dead.  Before long, I’ll be dead.  And you
                         and your brother and your sister and all of
                         her children. All of us dead. All of us
                         rotting in the ground. It’s the family name
                         that lives on. It’s all that lives on. Not
                         your personal glory, not your honor, but
                         family. Do you understand?
               JAIME AND TYWIN NOD TO EACH OTHER. TYWIN FINISHES
               DRESSING THE BOAR, AND CLEANS HIS HANDS ON A RAG.
                                    TYWIN
                         You’re blessed with abilities that few men
                         possess. You’re blessed to belong to the
                         most powerful family in the Kingdoms.And
                         you’re still blessed with youth.And what
                         have you done with these blessings, eh?
                         You’ve served as a glorified bodyguard for
                         two kings one a madman, the other a drunk.
                         The future of our family will be determined
                         in these next few months. We could
                         establish a dynasty that will last a
                         thousand years, or we could collapse into
                         nothing as the Targaryens did.

                        Let’s start over, shall we? You be the man,
                        and you be the woman. Go ahead. Slowly.
               CU AND MS OF AREMCA AND ROS STARTING AGAIN, WHILE

                        You’re not fooling them. They just paid
                        you. They know what you are. They know
                        it’s all just an act. Your job is to make
                        them forget what they know and that takes
                        time. You need to ease into it. Go ahead,
                        ease into it. He’s winning you over, in
                        spite of yourself. You’re starting to like
                        this. He wants to believe you. He’s
                        enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to
                        play with it, why shouldn’t you? He knows
                        he’s better than other men. He’s always
                        known it, deep down inside. Now he has
                        proof. He’s so good, he’s reaching
                        something deep inside of you that no one
                        even knew was there overcoming your very
                        nature.

                        I do believe my lord’s in love.

                        For many years. Most of my life, really.
                        Play with her ass. And she loved me, too.
                        I was her little confidant, her plaything.
                        She could tell me anything, anything at all.
                        She told me about all the horses that she
                        liked, the castle that she wanted to live
                        in, and the man that she wanted to marry. A
                        northerner, with a jaw like an anvil. So I
                        challenged him to a duel. I mean, why not?
                        I’d read all the stories. The little hero
                        always beats the big villain in all the
                        stories. In the end, she wouldn’t even let
                        him kill me.  “He’s just a boy,” she said.
                        “Please don’t hurt him.” So he gave me a
                        nice little scar to remember him by, and off
                        they went.

                        Is she still married to him?
                                    LITTLEFINGER
                        Oh, no.  He got himself killed before the
                        wedding. And she ended up with his brother,
                        an even more impressive specimen. She loves
                        him, I’m afraid. And why wouldn’t she? I
                        mean, who could compare to him? He’s just
                        so … good. Do you know what I learned,
                        losing that duel? I learned that I’ll never
                        win. Not that way. That’s their game,
                        their rules.  I’m not going to fight them.
                        I’m going to fuck them. That’s what I know.
                        That’s what I am. And only by admitting
                        what we are, can we get what we want.

                        is. Now wash yourselves. Both of you are

                        Have you ever seen a dragon, khaleesi? I
                        believe what my eyes and ears report. As
                        for the rest, it was three hundred years
                        ago. Who knows what really happened? Now
                        if you’ll pardon me, I’ll seek out the
                        merchant captain, see if he has any letters
                        for me.
