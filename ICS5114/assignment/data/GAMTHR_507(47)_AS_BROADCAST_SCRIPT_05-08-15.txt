           A horse's muzzle is visible. Snow is falling. 
                                        
           ( horse snorts ) 
                                        
           A man's hand sheathes a sword. A man puts a saddle on a horse.

           Dolorous Edd and another man grasp Tormund's arms and walk with him through the courtyard. 
           They bring him to Jon Snow. Jon and Tormund stare at one another. Jon nods, and Dolorous 
           removes the handcuffs from Tormund's wrists. Alliser Thorne watches from a distance. Jon walks up 
           to Alliser.

                           JON 
                  First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black. 
                                        
     01:03:00:29                        
                          ALLISER 
                    Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you 
                                        
     01:03:03:14                        
                        ALLISER (CONT'D) 
                   I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, 
                                        
     01:03:06:24                        
                        ALLISER (CONT'D) 
                      and an insult to all the brothers 
                                        
     01:03:08:24                        
                        ALLISER (CONT'D) 
                     who have died fighting the wildlings. 
                                        
                                        
     01:03:11:24 
                                        
           Jon speaks without evident emotion. 
                                        
                           JON 
                    As always, thank you for your honesty. 
                                        
           Jon walks away from Alliser. He walks up to Samwell Tarly. 
                                        
     01:03:21:15

                      Safe travels, Lord Commander. 
                                        
     01:03:23:05                        
                           JON 
                         Thank you, Sam. 
                                        
     01:03:25:15                        
                           SAM 
                          Oh, um... 
                                        
           Sam hands a bag to Jon. Jon opens the bag and removes a sharp-looking blade. 
                                        
     01:03:32:29                        
                         SAM (CONT'D) 
                         It's dragonglass. 
                                        
     01:03:34:17                        
                         SAM (CONT'D) 
                    It's what I used to kill the white walker. 
                                        
     01:03:41:24                        
                         SAM (CONT'D) 
                      I hope you don't need them.

                          Me, too. 
                                        
           Jon and Sam embrace. Olly stands watching. Jon mounts his horse. As he and his men ride off, 
           Alliser watches after them.

           Maester Aemon lies in bed.   
                                        
           ( Aemon gasping )

           Gilly stands near Aemon's bed, holding out little Sam for Aemon to see. Aemon smiles and reaches 
           out to the baby. 
                                        
           ( coos )

                          There he is.

                       AEMON (OS - CONT'D) 
                        Egg laughed like that. 
                                        
           Sam, standing nearby, smiles slightly. Gilly turns to him.

                     One of the first things I remember. 
                                        
     01:04:38:22                        
                                        
           Sam explains Aemon's comment to Gilly. 
                                        
                           SAM

           Aemon, lying in bed, looks very weak. Sam and Gilly both look serious.

           Theon Greyjoy enters the corridor holding a tray. He puts down the tray and unlocks a door. Then 
           he opens the door, picks up the tray, and enters.

           Theon enters Sansa's chamber carrying the tray. He shuts the door behind him.

           Sansa is lying in bed.

           Theon hesitates a moment. Then he advances to a table and puts down the tray. Sansa does not 
           move. Theon walks to the door. Sansa suddenly raises her head. She sits up.

           Theon walks a few steps toward the center of the room.

     01:06:03:16                        
                                        
           Sansa's voice is tearful.    
                                        
                           SANSA 
                           Theon. 
                                        
     01:06:05:22                        
                           THEON 
                         Do what he says. 
                                        
     01:06:07:04                        
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                     Do what he says or he'll hurt you. 
                                        
     01:06:08:21                        
                                        
           Sansa shakes her head. She sounds desperate. 
                                        
                           SANSA 
                     He already hurts me every night. 
                                        
     01:06:11:18                        
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                      All day I'm locked in this room 
                                        
     01:06:13:00                        
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                      and every night he comes... 
                                        
     01:06:17:20                        
                                        
           Sansa swallows. She speaks quietly. 
                                        
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                        It can't be any worse. 
                                        
     01:06:19:05                        
                           THEON 
                      It can. It can always be worse. 
                                        
     01:06:32:06                        
                                        
           Sansa stands and walks to Theon. He backs away. 
                                        
                         SANSA , THEON 
                       What did he do to you?                                              
                           Please. 
                                        
           Theon turns to the door. Sansa lunges after him. She cries out. 
                                        
                                        
     01:06:33:25 
                         SANSA , THEON 
                       You betrayed my family!                             
                        I'm sorry! I'm sorry! 
                                        
     01:06:36:21                        
                           SANSA 
                    You have to help me. Theon, help me. 
                                        
     01:06:39:01                        
                                        
           Theon looks down. His voice sounds choked with fear. 
                                        
                           THEON 
                     He'll see us. You don't know him. 
                                        
     01:06:42:13                        
                           SANSA 
                    My family still has friends in the North. 
                                        
     01:06:44:03                        
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                 All I need to do is give a signal and they'll rescue me. 
                                        
     01:06:47:08                        
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                    Climb to the top of the broken tower. 
                                        
     01:06:49:27                        
                                        
           Sansa speaks rapidly. She picks up a candle and presses it into Theon's hand. 
                                        
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                    Light this candle and put it in the window. 
                                        
     01:06:51:27                        
                         SANSA , THEON 
                        Promise me, Theon.                            
                       Reek! My name is Reek.

           Sansa puts her hands on Theon's shoulders and steadies him. She speaks firmly. 
                                        
                           SANSA 
                      Your name is Theon Greyjoy.

                         Do you hear me? 
                                        
           Theon finally raises his head and looks at her. 
                                        
     01:07:09:24

           Theon gives a tiny nod. Sansa drops her hands. Theon leaves the room.

           Theon walks through a snowstorm, the candle clutched in his hand.

           Theon enters Ramsay's chamber. Ramsay is sitting at his desk. 
                                        
                          RAMSAY

           Theon looks down.

           Brienne stands looking at Winterfell. Her expression is grim.

                         SAM (CONT'D) 
                        I can't leave him now.

           Aemon cries out in a shrill voice.  
                                        
                          AEMON - OS 
                           Egg! 
                                        
           Aemon's hand flies up. Sam catches and holds it. 
                                        
     01:09:15:19                        
                                        
           Aemon lies on his back, his chest heaving. 
                                        
           ( labored breathing )

                           Egg. 
                                        
                                        
     01:09:29:27                        
                                        
           His voice is wondering.      
                                        
                        AEMON (CONT'D) 
                          I dreamed... 
                                        
                                        
     01:09:32:16                        
                        AEMON (CONT'D) 
                         that I was old. 
                                        
           Sam holds Aemon's hand. Gilly sits by.

           Aemon has died. He lies on the ground on a bed of sticks, as light snow falls. 
                                        
                          SAM - OS 
                     His name was Aemon Targaryen.

                     He came to us from King's Landing.

                        or gentler or kinder.

                        SAM (OS - CONT'D) 
                   came and went during his years of service, 
                                        
     01:10:14:01                        
                        SAM (OS - CONT'D) 
                    but he was always there to counsel them.

            Sam stands with the Night's Watchmen and Alliser Thorne. Gilly stands nearby, holding little Sam. 
                                        
                         SAM (CONT'D) 
                     He was the blood of the dragon...

                         SAM (CONT'D) 
                      but now his fire has gone out. 
                                        
                                        
     01:10:28:05 
                         SAM (CONT'D) 
                      And now his watch is ended. 
                                        
     01:10:30:02                        
                                        
           Behind Sam, the Night's Watchmen speak in unison. 
                                        
                        NIGHT'S WATCHMEN 
                      And now his watch is ended.

           Sam leans forward with a torch to light the pyre. He hands the torch to Alliser, who lights the pyre in 
           a different spot.

           Alliser hands the torch to a Watchman and leans over to whisper to Sam. 
                                        
                          ALLISER 
                     You're losing all your friends, Tarly. 
                                        
           Sam looks around at the faces of the Watchmen as the pyre burns.

           Sansa climbs the steps to the battlement, surrounded by guards. Ramsay is looking out over the 
           battlement. She approaches him. Ramsay turns and looks at her for a moment. Then he smiles. 
                                        
                          RAMSAY

           Ramsay kisses Sansa's cheek.  
                                        
                          RAMSAY 
                   When my father told me we were marrying,

           Sansa does not react. Ramsay walks away, and she follows. They walk around the battlement as 
           Ramsay speaks.

           Ramsay looks furious. He pauses as if trying to control himself. 
                                        
                          RAMSAY

           Sansa's expression is surprised.

           Ramsay begins walking again, Sansa following. 
                                        
                        RAMSAY (CONT'D)

           Ramsay smiles and holds a finger in the air as if just remembering something.

           From under his cloak Ramsay reveals the candle that Sansa gave to Theon. His voice is light. 
                                        
                        RAMSAY (CONT'D)

           Sansa's chest is heaving. Ramsay speaks to a guard.

           Sansa looks about to cry. Ramsay kisses her cheek, then watches her walk away with her guards. He

           A few men can be seen gathered outside their tents. Some are huddled in blankets. A man rides up 
           on a horse. His face becomes clear; it is Davos Seaworth. He enters the command tent.

                           DAVOS 
                    We still have a hard march to Winterfell 
                                        
     01:16:12:01                        
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                 and we won't be marching anywhere in this weather. 
                                        
     01:16:13:18                        
                          STANNIS 
                           And? 
                                        
     01:16:15:09                        
                           DAVOS 
                        This isn't our time. 
                                        
     01:16:16:27                        
                                        
           Davos' voice is nearly violent.  
                                        
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                We should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears. 
                                        
     01:16:20:15                        
                          STANNIS 
                   I retreated from King's Landing, Ser Davos. 
                                        
     01:16:22:28                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                  If I retreat again, I'll become the King Who Ran. 
                                        
     01:16:26:14                        
                                        
           Davos begins to speak; Stannis will not let him. 
                                        
                         DAVOS,  STANNIS 
                          Your Grace--                  
                        Winter is coming. 
                                        
     01:16:28:18                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                   Those aren't just the Stark words. It's a fact. 
                                        
     01:16:31:17                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                     If we march back to Castle Black, 
                                        
     01:16:34:16                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                       we winter at Castle Black. 
                                        
     01:16:36:24                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                     And who can say how many years 
                                        
     01:16:38:29                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                        this winter will last? 
                                        
     01:16:40:21                        
                           DAVOS 
                 It's better to wait for the right time than risk everything. 
                                        
     01:16:42:23                        
                                        
           Stannis speaks quickly.      
                                        
                          STANNIS 
                   This is the right time and I will risk everything. 
                                        
     01:16:45:04                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                      Because if I don't, we've lost. 
                                        
     01:16:48:10                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                        We march to victory 
                                        
     01:16:50:14                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                       or we march to defeat. 
                                        
     01:16:54:13                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                     But we go forward. Only forward. 
                                        
     01:17:06:27                        
                                        
           Stannis turns away. Davos hesitates for a long moment. He looks toward Melisandre, now visible 
           standing to one side. She does not meet his eyes. Davos speaks quietly. 
                                        
                           DAVOS 
                          Your Grace. 
                                        
           Davos leaves the tent. Stannis addresses Melisandre without looking at her. 
                                        
     01:17:13:10                        
                          STANNIS 
                       I've trusted in your visions 
                                        
     01:17:15:29                        
                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                      and your prophecies for years. 
                                        
     01:17:19:01                        
                                        
           Melisandre speaks confidently, smiling slightly. 
                                        
                         MELISANDRE 
                      You saw it yourself, my king, 
                                        
     01:17:21:20                        
                       MELISANDRE (C0NT'D) 
                     when you stared into the flames. 
                                        
     01:17:23:19                        
                       MELISANDRE (C0NT'D) 
                       A great battle in the snow. 
                                        
     01:17:25:06                        
                       STANNIS , MELISANDRE 
                       I don't know what I saw.                                        
                         You do know. 
                                        
                                        
     01:17:27:09                        
                         MELISANDRE 
                         Trust yourself. 
                                        
     01:17:28:16                        
                          STANNIS 
                      And you? Do you trust yourself? 
                                        
     01:17:30:25                        
                         MELISANDRE 
                        I trust in the Lord. 
                                        
     01:17:35:19                        
                                        
           Stannis finally looks at her.  
                                        
                          STANNIS 
                         Are you sure? 
                                        
     01:17:43:14                        
                                        
           Melisandre comes close to him and gazes into his face. 
                                        
                         MELISANDRE 
                I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Winterfell. 
                                        
     01:17:47:00                        
                       MELISANDRE (C0NT'D) 
                I have seen the flayed man banners lowered to the ground. 
                                        
           Melisandre bends over the table on which the battle is mapped out. She lowers two figures. She 
           straightens again, close to Stannis. He seems about to kiss her; she does not respond. 
                                        
     01:18:00:17                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. 
                                        
     01:18:06:02                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                   I have shown you the power of king's blood. 
                                        
                                        
                                        
     01:18:09:20                        
                       MELISANDRE (C0NT'D) 
                       The usurper Robb Stark. 
                                        
     01:18:11:05                        
                       MELISANDRE (C0NT'D) 
                      The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. 
                                        
     01:18:13:15                        
                          STANNIS 
                    We don't have Robert's bastard here. 
                                        
     01:18:16:00                        
                         MELISANDRE 
                      No, we have someone better. 
                                        
     01:18:20:28                        
                       MELISANDRE (C0NT'D) 
                    And your blood runs through her veins. 
                                        
     01:18:25:01                        
                                        
           Stannis draws back slightly. His tone is incredulous. 
                                        
                          STANNIS 
                       Have you lost your mind? 
                                        
     01:18:27:00                        
                         MELISANDRE 
                        Do you doubt me? 
                                        
     01:18:28:21                        
                       MELISANDRE (CONT'D) 
                           Still? 
                                        
     01:18:31:06                        
                       MELISANDRE (C0NT'D) 
                       After all that you've seen. 
                                        
     01:18:32:26                        
                          STANNIS 
                      There must be another way. 
                                        
     01:18:34:20                        
                     STANNIS (CONT'D), MELISANDRE 
                     Leeches or-- - There is only one way. 
                                        
           Melisandre grasps the sides of Stannis' face. Her voice is persuasive.

                     MELISANDRE (C0NT'D), STANNIS 
                    To this decision. - She's my daughter. 
                                        
           Melisandre caresses his head. Stannis jerks away.

                        STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                          Get out. 
                                        
           Without argument, Melisandre leaves.

           INT. CASTLE BLACK MESS HALL - NIGHT 
                                        
           Gilly wrings out a wet cloth. Then she rises and begins arranging it in a bowl with other clothes. 
           Derek and Brant enter while she is busy. 
                                        
           ( door opens )

                           DEREK 
                     There's always some sort of grub on. 
                                        
     01:19:17:14                        
                           BRANT 
                      A bit of mutton would be nice. 
                                        
     01:19:22:28                        
                         DEREK, MAN 
                      A beauty from beyond the Wall.                       
                         ( man chuckles ) 
                                        
           Gilly picks up her laundry and begins to leave. 
                                        
     01:19:27:05                        
                           BRANT 
              Where you going, love? Aren't we better-looking than the fat man? 
                                        
     01:19:29:24                        
                           DEREK 
               No, the question is, is she pretty down south in the real world 
                                        
     01:19:32:27                        
                         DEREK (CONT'D) 
                   or is she pretty 'cause she's the only girl here? 
                                        
     01:19:34:25                        
                           BRANT 
                    Even in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss. 
                                        
           Gily pauses as he blocks her way, but does not make eye contact. 
        
                                        
     01:19:36:24                        
                         BRANT (CONT'D) 
                      Come on, love, give us a kiss. 
                                        
     01:19:39:24                        
                                        
           Now Gilly looks up at him.   
                                        
                         GILLY,  DEREK 
                         Leave me alone.                                                                                                                         
                  Oh, if you were my girl, I wouldn't leave you alone. 
                                        
                                        
     01:19:42:24                        
                         BRANT, DEREK 
                         One little kiss.                                                                                                                                                             
                       Come on, give him a kiss. 
     01:19:44:12                        
                           BRANT 
                     A man gets lonely guarding the Wall. 
                                        
           Gilly, looking exasperated, tries to walk past. The men block her way. Her laundry falls to the 
           ground. Derek's voice loses its humor and becomes threatening. 
                                        
     01:19:51:00                        
                           DEREK 
                      There's no need to be rude. 
                                        
     01:19:52:18                        
                         DEREK (CONT'D) 
                      We just want a little affection. 
                                        
           Gilly slaps him.             
                                        
     01:19:54:24                        
                           BRANT 
                         Ooh. ( laughs ) 
                                        
     01:19:58:17                        
                                        
           The men are on either side of her, penning her in. Sam enters the room and draws his sword. The 
           two men and Gilly turn to look at him. 
                                        
                           SAM 
                       Get your hands off her. 
                                        
     01:20:00:19

                         SAM (CONT'D) 
                   I believe you both have guard duty tonight. 
                                        
                                        
                                        
     01:20:05:15                        
                                        
           Derek's voice is jocular.    
                                        
                           DEREK 
                         Sam the Slayer. 
                                        
     01:20:07:02                        
                         DEREK (CONT'D) 
                     You gonna slay me with that sword? 
                                        
     01:20:08:21                        
                                        
           Brant's tone is also teasing.  
                                        
                           BRANT 
                       Look at his hand shake. 
                                        
     01:20:10:06                        
                                        
           Sam speaks quietly and urgently.  
                                        
                           SAM 
                          Gilly, go on. 
                                        
     01:20:12:10                        
                         SAM (CONT'D) 
                    Get back to your room, lock the door. 
                                        
           Derek shoves Gilly to the floor. Sam advances toward him.

           The men grapple. Derek pushes Sam to the floor.

           Gilly begins hitting Brant, who is blocking her from reaching Sam.

           Gilly sits on the bed. She leans forward and kisses Sam. 
        
                                        
           ( breathing quickens )

                           GILLY 
                        Am I hurting you? 
                                        
           Sam shakes his head.         
                                        
     01:24:18:10                        
                           GILLY 
                         Are you sure? 
                                        
           Sam nods.                    
                                        
     01:24:45:21                        
                                        
           Gilly makes love to him.

           The prisoners walk in a line, chained together. At the back is Jorah Mormont. Behind him is Tyrion 
           Lannister, followed by a guard with a whip. 
                                        
           ( chains rattling )

           The guard hits Tyrion with the whip.

     01:25:09:10 
                                        
           The prisoners stand on a wooden platform in front of a crowd of buyers. A guard unlocks Jorah and 
           brings him to the front of the platform as Malko talks. 
                                        
                           MALKO 
                   A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends. 
                                        
     01:25:11:23                        
                         MALKO (CONT'D) 
                   Not your usual street tough or drunken pirate. 
                                        
     01:25:15:26                        
                         MALKO (CONT'D) 
                      This one's a Westerosi knight 
                                        
     01:25:19:08                        
                         MALKO (CONT'D) 
                  from an ancient house trained in sword and lance.

                    He fought beside the stag king Robert 
                                        
     01:25:26:03                        
                         MALKO (CONT'D) 
                     on the far side of the Narrow Sea. 
                                        
     01:25:28:02                        
                         MALKO (CONT'D) 
                He was first through the breach during the Siege of Spike, 
                                        
     01:25:31:06                        
                         MALKO (CONT'D) 
                   slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword. 
                                        
     01:25:34:24                        
                                        
           Malko paces around the platform, gesturing as he speaks. Jorah doesn't move. 
                                        
                         MALKO (CONT'D) 
                  He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. 
                                        
     01:25:38:24                        
                         MALKO (CONT'D) 
                       Betrayed by his woman, 
                                        
     01:25:41:06                        
                                        
           Jorah makes eye contact with Tyrion, who is standing to one side. Then he looks away. 
                                        
                         MALKO (CONT'D) 
                   he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. 
                                        
     01:25:44:22                        
           ( crowd murmurs )            
                        MALKO (OS - CONT'D) 
                     Bidding begins at 12 gold honors. 
                                        
     01:25:48:22                        
                                        
           A buyer raises his hand.     
                                        
                        MALKO  (CONT'D) 
                         13. Do I have 14? 
                                        
     01:25:52:03                        
                                        
           Another man raises his hand. Jorah stands impassively. 
                                        
                         MALKO (CONT'D)

                           MALKO 
                         Do I hear 16? 16? 
                                        
     01:25:59:15                        
                           YEZZAN 
                          Twenty. 
                                        
           Yezzan holds up a purse. Malko points to him. 
                                        
     01:26:01:14                        
                           MALKO 
                           Sold. 
                                        
           Yezzan throws him the purse. Malko jerks Jorah off the platform and Yezzan begins to lead him 
           away. Tyrion watches. Then he lunges forward. 
                                        
     01:26:12:08                        
                           TYRION 
                     Wait! You have to buy me as well. 
                                        
           A guard yanks Tyrion back by his neck chain. Yezzan turns to listen. 
                                        
     01:26:15:09                        
                           YEZZAN 
                           Why? 
                                        
     01:26:17:19                        
                           TYRION 
                         We're a team. 
                                        
     01:26:19:14                        
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       I'm a great fighter, too. 
                                        
     01:26:21:00                        
                                        
           All the buyers laugh.        
                                        
           ( laughing )                 
                                        
     01:26:24:07                        
                           MALKO 
                    He's funny. You have to give him that. 
                                        
     01:26:27:01                        
                                        
           The guard behind Tyrion is laughing. Suddenly Tyrion yanks his chain. 
                                        
           ( laughing )                 
                                        
                                        
                                        
     01:26:30:04                        
                                        
           ( grunts )                   
                                        
           The man falls to the ground. Tyrion beats him with the chain and kicks him, to the amusement of 
           the crowd. 
                                        
     01:26:31:18                        
                                        
                          ( grunting ) - ( laughing continues ) 
        
                                        
     01:26:36:21                        
                                        
                         Yezzan watches without reacting. 
                                        
           ( grunting, shouting )       
                                        
     01:26:53:28                        
                                        
           Tyrion stops beating the guard and turns to Yezzan, who looks thoughtful. 
                                        
                           YEZZAN 
                       You're right, he's funny. 
                                        
           Yezzan hands some coins to Malko and nods to Tyrion. 
                                        
     01:27:04:02                        
                           TYRION 
                      Thank you, my lord. Thank you. 
                                        
     01:27:05:22                        
                           YEZZAN 
                           Yes.

                           TYRION 
                         My lord, if I may. 
                                        
     01:27:09:10                        
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   I've heard Meereen has become a free city. 
                                        
     01:27:11:19                        
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
              You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. 
                                        
     01:27:14:17                        
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                Now, if you were to fight freed men who'd be paid a wage-- 
                                        
           Yezzan hits him in the face.  
                                        
     01:27:20:06                        
                           YEZZAN 
                      There's your wages, funny man. 
                                        
           Yezzan tosses Tyrion a coin.  
                                        
     01:27:22:08                        
                        YEZZAN (CONT'D) 
                      Should last the rest of your life. 
                                        
           Yezzan walks away. Tyrion and Jorah follow. 
                                        
     01:27:26:08                        
                          MALKO (OS) 
                   These are warrior hands, not a serving girl's. 
                                        
     01:27:29:14                        
                          MALKO (OS) 
                         5, going once... 
                                        
     01:27:31:09                        
           INT. DANY'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT  
                                        
           Daenerys Targaryen and Daario Naharis are in bed together. 
                                        
           ( giggles )                  
                                        
     01:27:35:09                        
                          DAARIO 
               How long before the King of Meereen comes to claim my pillow? 
                                        
                                        
     01:27:38:21                        
                          DAENERYS 
                        Don't be ridiculous. 
                                        
           Dany caresses Daario's face.  
                                        
     01:27:40:18                        
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                     My marriage to Hizdahr is political. 
                                        
     01:27:44:14                        
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                   I think he's smart enough to understand that. 
                                        
     01:27:48:17                        
                          DAARIO 
                  I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing 
                                        
     01:27:50:23                        
                        DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                     because their leader was made king. 
                                        
     01:27:55:22                        
                          DAENERYS 
                         Are you jealous? 
                                        
     01:27:58:06                        
                          DAARIO 
                  You think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man 
                                        
     01:28:00:22                        
                        DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                    just because he represents competition? 
                                        
     01:28:03:08                        
                          DAENERYS 
                           I do. 
                                        
           Dany's voice is amused; Daario also smiles. 
                                        
     01:28:05:03                        
                                        
           ( laughs )                   
                                        
                                        
     01:28:06:24 
                          DAARIO 
                          You're right. 
                                        
     01:28:08:20                        
                        DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                     My motivations are entirely impure. 
                                        
           Daario rolls on top of Dany and kisses her. Then he whispers. 
                                        
     01:28:20:06                        
                        DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                       Doesn't make me wrong. 
                                        
     01:28:26:16                        
                                        
           He begins kissing her neck passionately. 
                                        
                          DAENERYS 
               You told me yourself I can't fight enemies within and without. 
                                        
     01:28:30:24                        
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                   So when enemies without come knocking, 
                                        
     01:28:33:07                        
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                    I need the city of Meereen behind me. 
                                        
     01:28:35:12                        
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                         I have no choice. 
                                        
     01:28:37:28                        
                          DAARIO 
                       Everyone has a choice. 
                                        
     01:28:39:19                        
                        DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                       Even slaves have a choice-- 
                                        
                                        
     01:28:41:10                        
                        DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                         death or slavery. 
                                        
     01:28:43:01                        
                          DAENERYS 
                      So what else can I do, hmm? 
                                        
     01:28:47:22                        
                                        
           Daario lifts himself up on his arms and looks at her. 
                                        
                          DAARIO 
                        Marry me instead. 
                                        
     01:28:51:06                        
                                        
           Dany smiles.                 
                                        
                          DAENERYS 
                  Even if I wanted to do such an inadvisable thing, 
                                        
     01:28:55:24                        
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                          I couldn't. 
                                        
     01:28:57:13                        
                          DAARIO 
                          Why not?

                    You are queen. You can do what you like. 
                                        
     01:29:03:16                        
                          DAENERYS 
                          No, I can't.

                Then you are the only person in Meereen who's not free.

           Daario moves to the side as Dany sits up. He caresses her back. 
                                        
                        DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                And I know I'm here to serve my queen and not give advice, 
                                        
     01:29:25:15                        
                        DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                    but can I make one more suggestion? 
                                        
     01:29:31:23                        
                                        
           Dany lies next to him again.  
                                        
                          DAENERYS 
                          Of course.

           Daario strokes her hair, places his hand on her shoulder. 
                                        
                          DAARIO 
                    All rulers are either butchers or meat.

           EXT. SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY    
                                        
           INT. SEPT OF BAELOR - DAY    
                                        
           Olenna walks up to the High Sparrow, who is scrubbing the floor. 
                                        
                          OLENNA 
                   You there. Where would I find the High Septon 
                                        
     01:30:14:03                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                 or High Sparrow or whatever bloody fool name he's got? 
                                        
     01:30:17:17                        
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                 It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I'll admit. 
                                        
     01:30:22:26                        
                          OLENNA 
                      You should have the decency 
                                        
     01:30:24:20                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                     to stand when you speak to a lady. 
                                        
     01:30:27:07                        
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                 You should have the decency to kneel before the gods. 
                                        
     01:30:30:01                        
                          OLENNA 
                      Don't spar with me, little fellow. 
                                        
     01:30:31:17                        
                                        
           The High Sparrow stands with effort. 
                                        
           ( groans )                   
                                        
     01:30:34:15                        
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                        For me, it's the knees. 
                                        
     01:30:37:20                        
                       HIGH SPARROW, OLENNA 
                           You? 
                           Hips. 
                                        
     01:30:39:18                        
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                           Ah. 
                                        
     01:30:41:23                        
                          OLENNA 
                    A man of the people. Is that your game? 
                                        
     01:30:45:17                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                    It's an old game. Dull and unconvincing. 
                                        
     01:30:49:12                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                        A man of the people 
                                        
     01:30:51:17                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                     who does Cersei's dirty work for her. 
                                        
     01:30:55:12                        
                                        
           The High Sparrow wrings out his wet cloth. 
                                        
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                     The people always do the dirty work. 
                                        
     01:30:57:14                        
                          OLENNA 
                Spare me the homilies. I can smell a fraud from a mile away. 
                                        
           Olenna's voice is unmoving. The High Sparrow responds mildly. 
                                        
                                        
     01:31:00:15                        
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                         Useful talent. 
                                        
     01:31:01:29                        
                          OLENNA 
                   I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter. 
                                        
     01:31:04:28                        
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                     Your grandson and granddaughter 
                                        
     01:31:07:10                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                      swore sacred vows and lied. 
                                        
     01:31:10:17                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                       The Father judges us all. 
                                        
     01:31:13:03                        
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                        Sons of high lords, 
                                        
     01:31:15:18                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                        sons of fishermen. 
                                        
     01:31:17:19                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                   If you break his laws, you will be punished. 
                                        
           The High Sparrow turns.      
                                        
     01:31:21:29                        
                          OLENNA 
                      Don't you walk away from me. 
                                        
     01:31:23:19                        
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                   You don't give commands here, Lady Olenna. 
                                        
                                        
     01:31:25:23                        
                          OLENNA 
                        What is it you want? 
                                        
           The High Sparrow stops at the door. 
                                        
     01:31:27:07                        
                          OLENNA 
                           Gold? 
                                        
     01:31:29:14                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                  I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived. 
                                        
     01:31:32:09                        
                                        
           The High Sparrow smiles.     
                                        
           ( chuckles )                 
                                        
     01:31:33:24                        
                          OLENNA 
                          What, then? 
                                        
     01:31:36:08                        
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                      I imagine this is strange for you. 
                                        
     01:31:39:07                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                    Everyone you meet has a hidden motive 
                                        
     01:31:41:23                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                    and you pride yourself on sniffing it out. 
                                        
     01:31:45:07                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                     But I'm telling you a simple truth. 
                                        
     01:31:47:17                        
                                        
           The High Sparrow spreads his arms. 
                                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                         I serve the gods. 
                                        
     01:31:49:28                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                       The gods demand justice. 
                                        
     01:31:51:28                        
                          OLENNA 
                   How do they communicate their demands? 
                                        
     01:31:54:09                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                        By raven or horse? 
                                        
     01:31:56:06                        
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                   By the holy text, "The Seven-Pointed Star." 
                                        
     01:31:59:06                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                     If you don't have one in your library, 
                                        
     01:32:01:23                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                        I'll give you my own. 
                                        
     01:32:03:01                        
                                        
           Olenna's tone is irritable.  
                                        
                          OLENNA 
                     I've read "The Seven-Pointed Star." 
                                        
     01:32:05:18                        
                        HIGH SPARROW - OS 
              Then you'll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. 
                                        
     01:32:10:00                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                     Your grandchildren will be punished 
                                        
                                        
     01:32:12:06

           Olenna does not move, but she is angry. 
                                        
                          OLENNA

           The High Sparrow listens calmly.  
                                        
                       OLENNA (OS - CONT'D) 
                  You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists, 
                                        
     01:32:25:10                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                       and yet you punish Loras

     01:32:33:01                        
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                  Yes. The gods' laws must be applied to all equally.

                       OLENNA (OS - CONT'D) 
                When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, 
                                        
     01:32:44:07                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                       everyone here will starve.

           The High Sparrow is amused.

                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                   And when the many stop fearing the few... 
                                        
           The High Sparrow picks up his cleaning bucket. He leaves without finishing his sentence.

           Olenna walks down the Sept stairs. 
                                        
                         TYRELL GUARD 
                         Lady Olenna. 
                                        
           The guard hands Olenna a scroll. She looks at the seal, then looks up. Her face is grim. 
                                        
     01:33:46:18

           Tommen sits stubbornly at the table, in front of a plate of food.

                      any better for her, my love. 
                                        
     01:33:53:12                        
                                        
           Tommen stands. Cersei is now visible, sitting across the table from him. Tommen sounds outraged. 
                                        
                          TOMMEN 
                        She's in a prison cell 
                                        
     01:33:55:14                        
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                      and there is nothing I can do. 
                                        
     01:34:01:25                        
                                        
                    Tommen walks around the table near Cersei. He shouts. 
        
                                        
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                         I am the king! 
                                        
     01:34:03:20                        
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                 The queen is in prison and there is nothing I can do! 
                                        
     01:34:21:04                        
                                        
           Cersei walks to him and takes his hands. 
                                        
                           CERSEI

     01:34:29:13                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   Events you couldn't possibly have anticipated 
                                        
     01:34:32:13                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D)

                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and what could I do? 
                                        
     01:34:44:23                        
                                        
           Cersei speaks with emotion.  
                                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                     Hold them as they left this world. 
                                        
     01:34:47:15                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                     Kissed their heads after they'd gone. 
                                        
     01:34:49:13                        
                                        
           Tommen is still furious.     
                                        
                          TOMMEN 
                        I'll call in the army. 
                                        
     01:34:51:20                        
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                        I'll take back the sept, 
                                        
     01:34:54:00                        
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                      and kill every last one of them. 
                                        
     01:34:59:07                        
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                       I'll start a war if I have to. 
                                        
     01:35:01:26                        
                           CERSEI 
              You know as well as I do who the first casualty of that war would be. 
                                        
                                        
     01:35:10:04                        
                                        
           Tommen lowers his voice. He sounds pained. 
                                        
                          TOMMEN 
                          I love her.

                          I love her... 
                                        
     01:35:19:19                        
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                        and I can't help her. 
                                        
     01:35:37:07                        
                                        
           Tommen sits in a chair. Cersei kneels next to him. Her voice is quiet. 
                                        
                           CERSEI 
                    We must be strong for those we love. 
                                        
     01:35:39:00                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                      We cannot give in to despair. 
                                        
     01:35:41:07                        
                          TOMMEN 
                     I will speak with the High Sparrow. 
                                        
     01:35:44:08                        
                        TOMMEN (CONT'D) 
                      There must be something he-- 
                                        
     01:35:45:23                        
                           CERSEI 
                     Let me talk to him on your behalf. 
                                        
     01:35:48:07                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
              The king cannot sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic. 
                                        
     01:35:53:10                        
                          TOMMEN 
                       You will try to help her? 
                                        
     01:35:55:11                        
                           CERSEI 
                I'll do everything I can to win her freedom and her brother's. 
                                        
     01:35:58:25                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                    Your happiness is all I want in this world. 
                                        
     01:36:03:02                        
                                        
           Tommen smiles slightly.      
                                        
                        TOMMEN, CERSEI 
                           I know.                                                                                                                                                 
                         No, you don't. 
                                        
     01:36:09:16                        
                           CERSEI 
                        You can't possibly. 
                                        
     01:36:13:05                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                    Not until you have children of your own. 
                                        
     01:36:16:05                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                      I would do anything for you. 
                                        
     01:36:20:05                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                     Anything to keep you from harm. 
                                        
     01:36:24:27                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                     I would burn cities to the ground. 
                                        
     01:36:28:28                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                       You are all that matters. 
                                        
     01:36:32:10                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                        You and your sister. 
                                        
           Cersei stands and, taking Tommen's hands, makes him rise with her. 
                                        
     01:36:36:11                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   From the moment you came into this world. 
                                        
     01:36:39:10                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                          My boy. 
                                        
           Cersei caresses Tommen's face. Then she embraces him. 
                                        
     01:36:44:04                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                         My only boy.

           INT. DOME - JAIME'S CHAMBER - DAY 
                                        
           Jaime sits in the sunlight at a barred window. 
                                        
           ( door opens )               
                                        
     01:37:01:08                        
                                        
           Hotah leads in Myrcella. Jaime stands. 
                                        
                           HOTAH 
                     Prince Doran hopes this satisfies 
                                        
     01:37:02:29                        
                         HOTAH (CONT'D) 
                   your concerns about the princess's well-being. 
                                        
           Hotah leaves. Jaime and Myrcella stare at one another. 
                                        
     01:37:12:19                        
                          MYRCELLA 
                     You looked different when I left. 
                                        
                                        
     01:37:14:25 
                        MYRCELLA (CONT'D) 
                        You had more hair. 
                                        
     01:37:17:02                        
                           JAIME 
                         And more hands. 
                                        
     01:37:20:02                        
                        JAIME,  MYRCELLA 
                         How's Trystane?                                                                                                                             
                         He'll be all right. 
                                        
     01:37:22:21                        
                           JAIME 
                        I'm sorry for that. 
                                        
     01:37:23:28                        
                         JAIME (CONT'D) 
                    It wasn't supposed to happen that way. 
                                        
     01:37:25:16                        
                          MYRCELLA 
                       Why is it happening at all? 
                                        
     01:37:28:23

     01:37:31:11                        
                         JAIME (CONT'D) 
                       Threats have been made. 
                                        
     01:37:33:22                        
                         JAIME (CONT'D) 
                      Dorne's too dangerous for you. 
                                        
     01:37:35:07                        
                        JAIME, MYRCELLA 
                      I've come to take you home.                                                                                                         
                         This is my home. 
                                        
     01:37:37:21                        
                        MYRCELLA (CONT'D) 
                     This has been my home for years. 
                                        
           Myrcella's voice rises; she sounds annoyed. 
                                        
     01:37:39:09                        
                        MYRCELLA (CONT'D) 
                   I didn't want to come here, but she told me to. 
                                        
     01:37:41:19                        
                        MYRCELLA (CONT'D) 
                        I did what she said. 
                                        
     01:37:42:26                        
                        MYRCELLA (CONT'D) 
                  I did my duty and now she's forcing me to go back? 
                                        
     01:37:45:19                        
                           JAIME 
                 It's for your own good. These are complicated matters. 
                                        
           Jaime's voice is dismissive; he turns back to the window. Myrcella sounds very annoyed. 
                                        
     01:37:48:22                        
                          MYRCELLA 
                    No, it's not complicated at all. It's simple. 
                                        
     01:37:51:02                        
                        MYRCELLA (CONT'D) 
                    I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him, 
                                        
     01:37:53:14                        
                        MYRCELLA (CONT'D) 
                      and we're staying right here. 
                                        
     01:37:54:29                        
                        JAIME , MYRCELLA

                        Your nose is bleeding. 
                                        
                                        
     01:40:36:07 
                           BRONN 
                       It's nothing. It's the dry air. 
                                        
     01:40:42:00                        
                                        
           Bronn falls to the ground. Tyene smiles. Her sisters stand to either side of her. 
                                        
                           TYENE 
                My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshai. 
                                        
     01:40:46:23                        
                         TYENE (CONT'D) 
                      They call it the Long Farewell. 
                                        
     01:40:49:11                        
                         TYENE (CONT'D) 
                        It takes time to work, 
                                        
     01:40:51:13                        
                         TYENE (CONT'D) 
                  but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, 
                                        
     01:40:55:17                        
                         TYENE (CONT'D) 
                           death. 
                                        
           Bronn's mouth is open. He is shaking. Tyene takes a tiny vial from around her neck. She holds it out. 
                                        
     01:41:04:29                        
                         TYENE (CONT'D) 
                        The only antidote. 
                                        
           Bronn reaches out weakly.    
                                        
     01:41:12:03                        
                         TYENE (CONT'D) 
                  Who's the most beautiful woman in the world? 
                                        
     01:41:15:26                        
                           BRONN 
                         ( quietly ) You. 
                                        
                                        
     01:41:18:15 
                           TYENE 
                         Sorry? Who? 
                                        
     01:41:23:00                        
                           BRONN 
                           You. 
                                        
     01:41:25:20                        
                           TYENE 
                         Don't drop it. 
                                        
           Tyene throws the vial into the cell. Bronn scrambles for it. He uncaps it and drinks the contents. 
                                        
     01:41:37:26                        
                                        
           ( gasping )                  
                                        
     01:41:41:14                        
                           TYENE 
                    I think you're very handsome as well. 
                                        
           Tyene smiles and closes her robe.

           A view of a room through the spy-hole.

           Littlefinger removes his gaze from the spy-hole. He walks away. 
                                        
           INT. LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY 
                                        
           Olenna waits for Littlefinger. A prostitute sleeps nearby. He enters the doorway. 
                                        
                       LITTLEFINGER, OLENNA 
                       I'm sorry about the locale.                                                                                                                  
                         No, you're not. 
                                        
     01:42:34:03                        
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                       It felt like the safest place. 
                                        
     01:42:36:07                        
                                        
           Olenna speaks sarcastically.  
                                        
                          OLENNA 
                      Not for your clientele, clearly. 
                                        
     01:42:39:14                        
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                    It was an establishment like no other. 
                                        
     01:42:43:03                        
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                    The sheer range of appetites catered to. 
                                        
     01:42:45:04                        
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                      Desires that didn't even exist 
                                        
     01:42:46:28                        
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                       until we invented them. 
                                        
     01:42:49:27                        
                          OLENNA 
               You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you? 
                                        
     01:42:54:13                        
                                        
           Littlefinger smiles.         
                                        
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                        The past is the past. 
                                        
     01:42:57:09                        
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                    The future is all that's worth discussing. 
                                        
     01:43:02:12                        
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                       The future of House Tyrell. 
                                        
     01:43:04:02                        
                                        
           Olenna speaks harshly.       
                                        
                          OLENNA 
                  Don't pretend to have any concern for my house, 
                                        
     01:43:06:24                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                       my grandchildren or me. 
                                        
     01:43:08:16                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                  I should have known you'd return to the capital 
                                        
     01:43:11:08                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                    as soon as things started to go wrong. 
                                        
     01:43:13:16                        
                       LITTLEFINGER, OLENNA 
                         I promise you--                                                                                                                                                
                      I promise you, Lord Baelish, 
                                        
     01:43:15:26                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                       that our fates are joined. 
                                        
     01:43:17:29                        
                                        
           There is taunting in Olenna's voice. 
                                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                      Together we murdered a king. 
                                        
     01:43:19:28                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                  If my house should fall, I will have nothing to hide. 
                                        
     01:43:24:14                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                    And if I should meet with some accident 
                                        
     01:43:28:00                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                    here at your broken little flesh market, 
                                        
     01:43:31:05                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                    they'll never even find what's left of you. 
                                        
     01:43:34:17                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                           So... 
                                        
     01:43:37:05                        
                        OLENNA (CONT'D) 
                      do you deny a part in all this? 
                                        
     01:43:39:07                        
                                        
           Littlefinger is undaunted, smiling.  
                                        
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                    Cersei summoned me to King's Landing. 
                                        
     01:43:42:17                        
                       LITTLEFINGER (CONT'D) 
                       I dared not refuse her. 
                                        
     01:43:44:02                        
                          OLENNA 
                       And what did she want? 
                                        
     01:43:45:28                        
                         LITTLEFINGER 
                   A piece of information she knew that I had.

           Olenna gives the slightest nod.

           Olenna raises her head. She looks at Littlefinger in apparent shock.

           Men are preparing themselves for the fight, donning armor. Jorah takes out his sword. Tyrion sits 
           nearby.

           Yezzan stands with a hand on his hip, watching the men.

           Jorah looks straight ahead as if preparing his thoughts. 
                                        
                        YEZZAN (OS - CONT'D)

           Jorah sits as if thinking while Yezzan begins to call on the fighters.

           Yezzan leads the men away. Jorah sets his sword upright and rests his hands on the hilt. His face is 
           expressionless.

           They sit. Dany looks nervous. The gate to the fighters' area opens and Yezzan leads out the fighters.

           Yezzan notices Dany. His eyes widen. He runs to stand in front of her and bow. 
                                        
                           YEZZAN

            Hizdahr nods, and Yezzan turns back to the fighters. He shoves them into position, hissing at them.

           Dany and Hizdahr sit and watch as the fighters attack each other. One man ferociously hits his 
           opponent and knocks him to the ground. Another plunges a knife into his opponent's throat.

           Dany looks distressed. The man falls to the ground, bleeding and trembling as he dies. Dany looks 
           down. Hizdahr looks at her.

           A man falls to the ground.   
                                        
           Hizdahr watches calmly, while Dany looks upset. Men hit each other. They fall. The crowd comes to 
           its feet. Another man falls.

           The unarmed man stands, holding out his hands. Another man attacks and brings him down. Dany 
           stands.

           Jorah hurries back to the bench and picks up his helmet. He runs back to the doorway. 
                                        
                           TYRION

                    Tyrion tries to follow Jorah, but he is chained to the wall.

           Jorah crashes through the gate. Yezzan looks around at him. 
                                        
                           YEZZAN 
                    Wait your turn, you piece of fucking filth. 
                                        
           Yezzan grabs Jorah's shoulder, and Jorah elbows him in the face. Yezzan falls.

           Dany hesitates. A fighter smashes another man's head with a stone. Blood flies. Jorah kicks the man 
           with the stone, knocking him backward. Dany watches. Jorah strides across the arena and knocks 
           down another man.

           Jorah is swordfighting with another man. He knocks him to the ground.

           As the last of the fighters leave, Tyrion tries to pull his chain out of the wall.

           Tyrion finds a file and begins filing the chain.

           Jorah faces a fighter swinging a morning star. He brings him down by hitting him with his shield. He 
           turns to another fighter. Dany watches tensely. 
                                        
           ( applause )

           Tyrion files furiously at the chain. Suddenly he looks up and sees a large man. Tyrion looks fearful as 
           the man swings his sword--and cuts Tyrion's chain apart. He nods, and Tyrion runs.

           Jorah is the only man standing. He walks to the canopy and removes his helmet. Dany looks at him. 
           Then she speaks painfully.

           Jorah raises his voice as guards grab him.

           The guards grapple him away, and Jorah shouts.

           Tyrion's voice is jaunty, and Dany looks around in surprise. Tyrion walks to where Jorah is struggling 
                            with the guards.

           Cersei carries a tray to Margaery.  
                                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                      I brought you this. Venison. 
                                        
     01:50:27:14                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                         It's quite good. 
                                        
     01:50:32:17                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                    I had it myself for supper only last night. 
                                        
     01:50:39:17                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
              We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. 
                                        
           Margaery sits without speaking.  
                                        
     01:50:42:20                        
                        CERSEI (OS - CONT'D) 
                    Tommen even went to the sept himself 
                                        
     01:50:44:28                        
                        CERSEI (OS - CONT'D) 
                      to confront the High Sparrow. 
                                        
     01:50:47:09                        
                                        
           Cersei stands near the door.  
                                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                   But I fear the Faith has left reason behind. 
                                        
           Margaery speaks angrily.     
                                        
     01:50:50:08                        
                         MARGAERY - OS 
                        I know you did this. 
                                        
     01:50:53:12                        
                           CERSEI 
                   We are making every effort on your behalf.

                        CERSEI (OS - CONT'D) 
                     I swear to you by all the seven gods.

                       Lies come easily to you. 
                                        
     01:51:02:00                        
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                        Everyone knows that. 
                                        
     01:51:03:15                        
                                        
           Cersei listens without moving.  
                                        
                       MARGAERY (OS - CONT'D) 
                         But innocence, 
                                        
     01:51:06:14                        
                       MARGAERY (OS - CONT'D) 
                        decency, concern, 
                                        
     01:51:09:03                        
                                        
           Margaery directs her gaze at Cersei as she speaks. 
                                        
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                    you're not very good at those, I'm afraid. 
                                        
     01:51:13:11                        
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                    Perhaps that's why your son was so eager 
                                        
     01:51:15:19                        
                        MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                       to cast you aside for me.

                         You're upset.

                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                       You're not thinking clearly.

                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                 I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down. 
                                        
     01:51:26:15                        
                          MARGAERY 
                      I don't want to see you again. 
                                        
     01:51:28:17                        
                           CERSEI 
                   I do hope you change your mind about that.

                     I've been told men often go mad

           Cersei speaks sweetly.       
                                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                    Though I suppose your isolation will end 
                                        
     01:51:37:24

                       when your trial begins.

                          MARGAERY 
                           Leave.

                         I'm afraid I must. 
                                        
     01:51:46:24

                    My son needs me now more than ever. 
                                        
     01:51:48:25                        
                                        
           Margaery throws her food at Cersei. She shouts. 
                                        
                          MARGAERY 
                       Get out, you hateful bitch!

           Cersei does not lose her calm. She smiles and turns to the door. Margaery stares after her. 
                                        
           ( knocks on door )

           Cersei speaks one last time.  
                                        
                           CERSEI

     01:52:11:19 
                                        
           Margaery rolls away in anger.

           Cersei walks down the corridor, escorted by a Faith Militant. She smiles.

           The Faith Militant precedes Cersei into the chapel and stands to one side as she enters. The High 
           Sparrow is there, waiting.

           The Faith Militant leaves.

                    Her accommodations seem sufficient.

                      It depends upon the situation.

                   The acts themselves, the degree of contrition.

           The High Sparrow changes the subject.

                  is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?

                      Baelor built his sept around it.

                 There's no name on it or anywhere else in the chapel.

               the way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity up there.

                         HIGH SPARROW 
                        Their faith was clean.

                    Strip away the gold and the ornaments, 
                                        
     01:54:33:16                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                    knock down the statues and the pillars,

           The High Sparrow runs his hand along the altar. 
                                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D)

           The High Sparrow looks at Cersei.  
                                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D)

                      HIGH SPARROW (OS - CONT'D) 
                       Their lies knocked down.

                      HIGH SPARROW (OS - CONT'D) 
                    Their true hearts laid bare for all to see.

                         What will we find 
                                        
     01:55:18:13                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                     when we strip away your finery? 
                                        
           Cersei tilts her head, listening.

                      HIGH SPARROW (OS - CONT'D) 
                    A young man came to us not long ago. 
                                        
     01:55:28:06                        
                                        
           The High Sparrow stands still and straight. 
                                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                       Broken in body and spirit.

                      He had so much to strip away. 
                                        
           Cersei frowns slightly.

                      HIGH SPARROW (OS - CONT'D) 
                      So much weighing him down.

                   But piece by piece, he unburdened himself. 
                                        
     01:55:45:20                        
                      HIGH SPARROW (OS - CONT'D) 
                         Let go of vanity, 
                                        
     01:55:47:21                        
                      HIGH SPARROW (OS - CONT'D) 
                          pride, sin. 
                                        
     01:55:52:23                        
                                        
           The High Sparrow smiles. His voice is ominously quiet. 
                                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                       Now his soul is so light, 
                                        
     01:55:55:12                        
                       HIGH SPARROW (CONT'D) 
                  he will float through the Seven Heavens like a bird. 
                                        
     01:55:58:18                        
                           CERSEI 
                           Hmm. 
                                        
     01:56:05:12                        
                         HIGH SPARROW 
                     And he has much to say about you. 
                                        
     01:56:07:28

           Lancel Lannister enters the room and stands next to the High Sparrow. Cersei turns to leave, but a 
           woman blocks her way. 
                                        
                           CERSEI 
                           Move. 
                                        
           Cersei tries to pass, and the woman holds her still. 
                                        
     01:56:35:25                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                       Let me go immediately. 
                                        
           The woman pulls Cersei's arms behind her and begins to handcuff her. Cersei shouts to the High 
           Sparrow. 
                                        
     01:56:38:18                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                      You will order her to let me go. 
                                        
           The High Sparrow and Lancel stand staring at her. Cersei is pulled from the room. 
                                        
     01:56:41:17                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                     I am the queen! I am the queen!

                       Have you lost your mind? 
                                        
     01:56:46:00                        
                                        
           The High Sparrow stands listening. Cersei screams from the hallway. 
                                        
                        CERSEI (OS - CONT'D)

           The woman pushes Cersei into the cell so that she falls on the floor. The woman turns to go. 
                                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                          Look at me.

           The woman looks.             
                                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D)
