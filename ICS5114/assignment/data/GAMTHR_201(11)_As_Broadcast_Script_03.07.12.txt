           A fight between a Morningstar and knight takes place in the
           courtyard as spectators look on.A Morningstar smashes a
           knight's helmeted head. The knight falls over the ledge
           and to the concrete below. Joffrey stands at the top of
           the landing.The crowd cheers.
                          JOFFREY
                   Well struck.Well struck, dog!
           The man removes his helmet.Joffrey turns to Sansa.
                          JOFFREY
                   Did you like that?
                          SANSA
                   It was well struck, your Grace.
                          JOFFREY
                   I already said it was well struck.
                          SANSA
                   Yes, your Grace.
           Joffrey looks at Sansa as though he has been insulted. Down
           below, two squires drag the dead man away, leaving a trail a
           fresh blood.
                          JOFFREY

                         Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!
        01:02:52
                                  DONTOS
                         Here I am! Here I am!
               Dontos fumbles as he descends the steps, dropping his helmet
               before composing himself. He is drunk.
                                  DONTOS
                         Sorry, your Grace. My deepest
                         apologies.
                                  JOFFREY (OS)
                         Are you drunk?
                                  DONTOS
                         No. Ah, no, your Grace. Ah, I had two
                         cups of wine.
                                  JOFFREY (OS)
                         Two cups?
               Dontos nods affirmatively.
                                  JOFFREY (CONT'D)
                         That's not much at all. Please, have
                         another cup.
                                  DONTOS
                         Are you sure, your Grace?
                                  JOFFREY
                         Yes. To celebrate my name day. Have
                         two. Have as much as you like.
                                  DONTOS
                         I'll be honored, your Grace.
                                  JOFFREY
                         Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my
                         name day. See that he drinks his fill.
               Dontos smiles. Meryn aggressively pushes him forward. The
               crowd reacts. Joffrey takes a seat and looks amused.

               Dontos drops to his knees. A kingsguard secures Dontos's
               hands behind his back. Another kingsguard jams the thin
               end of a drinking horn into Dontos's mouth while another
               overturns a wine tun and funnels the contents down the
               man's throat. Dontos gurgles.
        01:03:52
                                  SANSA
                        You can't.
                                  JOFFREY
                        What did you say?
               Sansa swallows hard and looks at Joffrey.
                                  JOFFREY
                        Did you say I can't?
                                  SANSA
                        I only meant it would be bad luck to
                        kill a man on your name day.
                                  JOFFREY
                        What kind of stupid, peasant
                        superstition--
                                  HOUND (OS)
                        The girl is right. What a man sows on
                        his name day he reaps all year.
               Joffrey takes a deep breath.
                                  JOFFREY
                        Take him away. I'll have him killed
                        tomorrow, the fool.
               Ser Meryn and the other kindsguard pull the horn from
               Dontos throat and push him to the ground. He vomits.
                                  SANSA
                        He is. A fool. You're so clever to
                        see it.  He'll make a much better fool
                        than a knight. He doesn’t deserve the
                        mercy of a quick death.

                   Did you hear my lady, Ser Dontos? From
                   this day, you'll be my new fool.
                          DONTOS
                   Thank you, your Grace.And you, my
                   lady, thank you.
           The kingsguards take Dontos away.
                          TYRION (OS)
                   Beloved nephew!
           Tyrion enters the courtyard and approaches Joffrey.
                          TYRION
                   We looked for you on the battlefield.
                   You were nowhere to be found.
                          JOFFREY
                   I've been here ruling the kingdoms.
                          TYRION (OS)
                   And what a fine job you've done.
                          TYRION (CONT'D - to Sansa)
                   Look at you.
           Tyrion kisses Sansa on the cheek.
                          TYRION (CONT'D)
                   More beautiful than ever.
                          TYRION (to Tommen)
                   And you! You're going to be bigger
                   than the Hound, but much better
                   looking.
           Tommen giggles, but the Hound is unamused.
                          TYRION
                   This one doesn’t like me.

                          JOFFREY
                   We heard you were dead.
                          MYRCELLA
                   I'm glad you're not dead.
           Tyrion drinks wine from a goblet.
                          TYRION
                   Me too, dear. Death is so boring,
                   especially now with so much excitement
                   in the world.
           Tyrion turn to Sansa.
                          TYRION
                   My lady, I'm sorry for your loss.
                          JOFFREY
                   Her loss? Her father was a confessed
                   traitor!
                          TYRION
                   But still her father. Surely having so
                   recently lost your own beloved father,
                   you can sympathize.
           Joffrey turns to Sansa and waits for a response.
                          SANSA
                   My father as a traitor. My mother and
                   brother were traitors, too.I am loyal
                   to my beloved Joffrey.
                          TYRION
                   Of course you are.
           A beat.
                          TYRION
                   Well, enjoy your name day, your Grace.
                   I wish I could stay and celebrate, but
                   there is work to be done.
           Tyrion walks away. Joffrey calls after him.

                        What work? Why are you here?
        01:06:19
               INT. RED KEEP - SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER -- DAY.
               A young master carries a white raven in a gold cage,
               covered with a cloth, to the table where Cersei,
               Littlefinger, Varys, Grand Maester Pycelle and Janos Slynt
               are seated.

                        The raven arrived from the Citadel this
                        morning, your Grace. The Conclave has
                        met, considered the reports from
                        masters all over the seven kingdoms,
                        and declared this great summer done, at
                        last. The longest summer in living
                        memory.
                                 VARYS
                        The peasants say a long summer means an
                        even longer winter.
                                 PYCELLE
                        A common superstition.

                        If it lasts any longer, we have fewer
                        peasants.

                        The city's drowning in refugees, your
                        Grace. Fleeing the war. We have
                        nowhere to house them and with winter
                        coming, it'll only get worse.

                                  JANOS SLYNT
                         I owe my title and lands to your
                         generosity, your Grace.

                         Then do your job. Shut the gates to
                         the peasants. They belong in the
                         field, not our capital.

               The group turns toward the direction of someone whistling.
               Tyrion walks in the room.
                                  TYRION
                         Don’t get up. More ravishing than
                         ever, big sister.
               Tyrion kisses Cersei on the cheek.
                                  TYRION

                        The stars don’t fall for men. The red
                        comet means one thing, boy.Dragons.
               Bran uses his arms to drag himself closer to the pool of
               water. He stairs into it and sees his own reflection.
        [MUSIC IN]
                                 BRAN
                        Dragons are all dead. They've been
                        dead for centuries.
               Bran distorts his reflection in the water by moving his
               hand across it. Osha looks up at the red comet.
               EXT. ESSOS - RED WASTE - DAY.
               Coming down from the red comet, the bedraggled remains of
               the khalasar cross the vast expanse of the Red Waste. The
               dragon is Drogon. He clings to Daenerys Targaryen's
               shoulders. Doreah and Irri walk near Dany, along with her
               bloodriders and Rakharo.
                                 DANY
                        Mmm. Mmmmmmmm.
                                 DOREAH
                        What did your brother say about them,
                        Khaleesi?
                                 DANY
                        He said they ate meat.
                                 DOREAH
                        He didn’t tell you what kind of meeat?
                                 DANY
                        My brother didn’t know anything about
                        dragons. He didn’t know anything about

               A horse collapses to the ground. The group reacts. Dany
               runs toward the felled horse.
                                  DANY
                         She was Troger's [PH] first gift to me.
                                  JORAH
                         I remember.
                                  DANY
                         I promised to protect them. I promised
                         them their enemies would die screaming.
                         How do I make starvation scream?
                                  JORAH
                         A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.
                                  DANY
                         Does it ever end?
                                  JORAH
                         It's further east than I've ever been,
                         but yes, Khaleesi. Everything ends,
                         even the Red Waste.
                                  DANY
                         You're sure there's no other way?
                                  JORAH
                         If we go south to the land of the
                         Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us
                         and take your dragons. If we go west
                         to the Dothraki Sea, the first khalasar
                         we meet will kill us and take your
                         dragons.
                                  DANY
                         No one will take my dragons.
                                  JORAH
                         They are too weak to fight. As are

               Craster and Mormont sit inside the room. Craster warms his

               through a flap of deer hide, serving as a door to the keep.

                        years. Haven't missed him. Always

           Melisandre stands in front of the fire with a great deal of
           confidence and power. Behind her stands knights carrying
           torches.
                          MELISANDRE

                   All you men were named in the light of
                   the Seven. Is this how you treat the
                   gods of your fathers? Are you so eager
                   to spit on your ancestors?
           Cressen pauses and looks around.No one says a word.
           After a few moments, Melisandre steps forward. She touches
           Cressen's cheek.
                          MELISANDRE
                   The smell of fear. Fear and piss and
                   old bones. Do you want to stop me?
                   Stop me.
           Some of the men exchange looks as silence fills the air.
           Cressen looks at Melisandre for a moment, then steps away.
                          MELISANDRE
                   In the ancient books, it's written that
                   a warrior will draw a burning sword
                   from the fire. And that sword should
                   be Lightbringer.
           Melisandre looks directly at Stannis.

                   Stannis Baratheon, Warrior of Light.
                   Your sword awaits you.
           After a beat, Stannis walks forward as Melisandre watches.
           He walks over to the fire as the men watch. He reaches for
           the sword, then pulls it from the flames. He thrusts the
           burning sword into the ground. Immediately, the knights
           fall to their knees.

                   Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.
                   By right of birth and blood, I do this
                   day lay claim to the Iron Throne of
                   Westeros. Let all true men declare
                   their loyalty.

                   When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he
                   told only me. I will not make the same
                   mistake. Send copies of that letter to
                   every corner of the realm, from the
                   Arbor to the Wall. The time has come
                   to choose. Let no man claim ignorance
                   as an excuse.
                          DAVOS
                   Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true
                   enemy. If, for the time being, you
                   could make peace with your brother...
                          STANNIS
                   I will not make peace with Renly while
                   he calls himself King.
                          DAVOS
                   Well many have already declared for
                   him. There's Tyrell [PH], Ronald

                   And how many ships does the Lord of

                   I owe you an apology, my King. My duty
                   is to serve.You have chosen the new

           offers his cup to Melisandre. They exchange looks.
           Cressen's nose begins to bleed. Melisandre does not take
           her eyes off of him as she finishes his drink. Davos
           watches. Cressen bleeds profusely from his nose and mouth.
           After several moments, he falls to the floor. The men

               EXT. STARK CAMP - STOCKADE - NIGHT.
               A man sits at the top of the watchtower as horses and
               guards mill about on the ground below. Robb Stark walks
               through the stockade, escorted by an guard carrying a
               torch. Robb is lead to Jaime Lannister who sits behind
               bars with his arms and lets chained to restrain him.He
               sits with his back against the wall.

                        expecting you to leave me in one castle
                        or another for safe keeping, but you
                        drag me along from camp to camp. Have
                        you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that
                        it? I've never seen you with a girl.

                   Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all
                   the high lords of Westeros.
                   KingJoffrey Baratheon is neither a true
                   king, not a true Baratheon.He's your

                   My father learned the truth. That's
                   why you had him executed.

                   I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost
                   his head.

                   Your son killed him so the world
                   wouldn’t know who fathered him, and
                   you, you pushed my brother from a

                   It's better than three defeats.
           Robb and Jaime exchange looks for a moment. Robb then
           releases the direwolf, who moves close to Jaime's face.
           The direwolf growls, snarls and chomps his teeth together
           just inches from Jaime's face. Jaime closes his eyes,
           helpless. When he opens his eyes again, the direwolf is
           gone and he is left alone in his cell.

                                                                   EPISODE #201
                        Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to
                        the truth.
                                  SHAE (laughing)
                        Truth? (LAUGH) You're the biggest
                        little liar I have ever met.

                        Why do you think I am so little?
                                  SHAE
                        (LAUGH)
               Tyrion leans over the bed. He grabs Shae's hands and
               smiles.  Shae rolls over to make room for Tyrion, who lays
               down next to her.
                                  TYRION
                        I'm being crushed beneath the weight of
                        all that truth. Ned Stark actually
                        slept on this. As if the poor man
                        didn’t suffer enough. One of the many
                        changes we'll have to make around here.
               Tyrion and Shae kiss.
               EXT. RED KEEP - COURTYARD - DAY.
               The courtyard is empty with the exception of a worker
               scrubbing blood from the floor. Littlefinger strolls
               through the archway. Cersei and a group of guards appear
               behind him.
                                  CERSEI
                        Lord Baelish.
               Littlefinger turns and bows when he hears his name.
                                  LITTLEFINGER
                        Your Grace.
                                  CERSEI
                        I wonder if I might ask you for a
                        favor?

                   Of course, your Grace.
                          CERSEI
                   Ned Stark's youngest daughter, Arya.
                   We can't seem to locate her.
      01:37:05
           Littlefinger strolls along with Cersei and guards.
                          LITTLEFINGER
                   If she's escaped the capital,
                   Winterfell seems the logical
                   destination.
                          CERSEI
                   And yet my friends in the north report
                   no sign of her.
                          LITTLEFINGER
                   Curious.
                          CERSEI
                   If we choose to negotiate with the
                   Starks, the girl has some value.
                   Whoever finds her, well, you know what
                   they say about the Lannisters and
                   debts.
                          LITTLEFINGER
                   Well, you could ask Varys where she is.
                   He'll have an answer for you. Whether
                   you believe it...Myself, I have
                   always had a hard time trusting
                   eunuchs. Who knows what they want?
                          CERSEI
                   Huh.
           Cersei reaches out and touches a mockingbird pendant on
           Littlefingers jacket.
                          CERSEI
                   A mockingbird. You created your own
                   sigil, didn’t you?

                   Yes.
                          CERSEI
                   Appropriate.For a self-made man with
                   so many songs to sing.

                          LITTLEFINGER
                   I'm glad you like it. Some people are
                   fortunate enough to be born into the
                   right family. Others have to find
                   their own way.
           Cersei nods subtly.
                          CERSEI
                   I heard a song once about a boy of
                   modest means. He found his way into
                   the home of a very prominent family.
           Littlefinger smiles and looks down.
                          CERSEI
                   He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly,
                   she had eyes for another.
                          LITTLEFINGER
                   When boys and girls live in the same
                   home, awkward situations can arise.
                   Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers
                   and sisters develop certain affections.
                   And when those affections become common
                   knowledge, well, that is an awkward
                   situation indeed.Especially in a
                   prominent family.Prominent families
                   often forget a simple truth, I found.
                          CERSEI
                   And which truth is that?
                          LITTLEFINGER
                   Knowledge is power.

        [MUSIC IN]
               The guards rush toward Littlefinger. He tries to fight
               them off, to no avail.
        01:38:44
                                  CERSEI
                        Cut his throat.
               One of the guards draws a dagger. Littlefinger is
               speechless as he continues to struggle.
                                  CERSEI
                        Stop. Wait. (LAUGH) I've changed my
                        mind. Let him go.
               The guards release Littlefinger.
                                  CERSEI
                        Step back three paces.
               The guard immediately obey Cersei and step away from
               Littlefinger.
                                  CERSEI
                        Turn around.
               The guards turn their backs to Cersei and Littlefinger.
                                  CERSEI
                        Close your eyes.
               Littlefinger looks around, confused. Cersei steps closer
               to him.
                                  CERSEI
                        Power is power. Do see if you could
                        take some time away from your coins and
                        your whores to locate the Stark girl
                        for me.  I would very much appreciate
                        it.
               Cersei walks away from Littlefinger. The guards follow
               her. The boy scrubbing blood from the courtyard floor has
               been paying attention. He goes back to his chore.

                   You are Ser Alton Lannister?
     01:39:31
           INT. STARK CAMP - STARK COMMAND TENT - NIGHT.
           Alton Lannister stands in front of Robb.
                          ALTON
                   I am, your Grace.
                          ROBB
                   I offer your cousins peace if they meet
                   my terms.
                          ROBB
                   First, your family must release my
                   sisters.
           Alton nods at Robb, who sits at a table with Theon, Rodrik
           and several other Northern Lords and River Lords.
                          ROBB
                   Second, my father's bones much be
                   returned to us so he may rest beside
                   his brother and sister in the crypts
                   beneath Winterfell. And the remains of
                   all those who died in the service must
                   also be returned so their families can
                   honor them with proper funerals.
                          ALTON
                   An honorable request, Your Grace.
                          ROBB
                   Third, Joffrey and the Queen Regent
                   must renounce all claim to dominion of
                   the North from this time to the end of
                   time when we are a free and independent
                   kingdom.
           Alton looks stunned, but says nothing.
                          RODRIK
                   The King of the North.
           The other Lords in the room echo Rodrik's statement.

                          ROBB
                   Neither Joffrey nor any of his men
                   shall set foot in our lands again. If
                   he disregards this command, then he
                   shall suffer the same fate as my
                   father.Only I don’t need a servant to
                   do my beheading for me.
                          ALTON
                   These are, your Grace, these are...
           Robb stands.
                          ROBB
                   These are my terms. If the Queen
                   Regent and her son meet them, I'll give
                   them peace. If not, I will little the
                   South with Lannister dirt.
                          ALTON
                   King Joffrey is a Baratheon, your
                   Grace.
                          ROBB
                   Oh is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser
                   Alton. That will be all for tonight.
           Robb's bannermen head for the exit. Theon stays behind.
                          THEON
                   A word, your Grace?
                          ROBB
                   You don’t have to call me your Grace
                   when no one's around.
                          THEON
                   It's not so bad, once you get used to
                   it.

                                  ROBB
                        Of course they are.

                        You can fight them in the fields as
                        long as you like. We won't beat them
                        until you take King's Landing. We
                        can't take King's Landing without
                        ships. My father has ships and men who
                        know how to sail them.

                        themselves from the yoke of the South.
                        Just like you're doing now. I'm his
                        only living son. He'll listen to me.
                        I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I
                        know that. But your father raised me
                        to be an honorable man. We can avenge
                        him together.
               INT. STARK CAMP - CATELYN STARK'S TENT - LATER.
               Catelyn argues with Robb in a candlelit tent.

                                  ROBB
                        I understand you don’t trust Lord
                        Greyjoy--
                                  CATELYN
                        I don’t trust Lord Greyjoy because he
                        is not trustworthy. Your father had to
                        go to war to end his rebellion.
                                  ROBB
                        Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling
                        against the throne. And before me, it
                        was father. You married one rebel and
                        mothered another.
                                  CATELYN
                        I mothered more than just rebels. A
                        fact you seem to have forgotten.
                                  ROBB
                        If I trade the Kingslayer for two
                        girls, my bannermen will string me up
                        by my feet.
                                  CATELYN
                        You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's
                        hands? And Arya? I haven’t heard a
                        word about Arya. What are we fighting
                        for if not for them?
                                  ROBB
                        It's more complicated than that! You
                        know it is!

                   boys. Tomorrow, you'll ride south the

                   you...
                          ROBB
                   Because I need you to negotiate with
                   Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army
                   of one hundred thousand. You know him.
                   You know his family.
                          CATELYN
                   I haven’t seen Renly Baratheon since he
                   was a boy. You have a hundred other
                   lords--

                          ROBB
                   Which of these lords do I trust more
                   than you? If Renly sides with us,
                   we'll outnumber them two to one.When
                   they feel the jaws beginning to shut,

           Catelyn thinks for a moment, then nods in agreement.

                   You've done so well. Your father would
                   be proud.
           After a long pause, steps away from Catelyn.

                   King Renly. There's a king in every

           INT. RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM - DAY.
           Workman are hard at work. Joffrey stands in the middle of
           the room and watches. Cersei enters with four Lannister
           guards.She approaches Joffrey.
                          CERSEI
                   What is all this?
                          JOFFREY
                   Turning this room to its proper
                   appearance. Say what you will about
                   the Targaryens. They were conquerors.
                   That is a seat for a conqueror. I need
                   a room to match it. Not vines and
                   flowers.
                          CERSEI
                   We can't find Arya Stark.
                          JOFFREY
                   With luck, she's dead in a ditch
                   somewhere.
                          CERSEI
                   Perhaps. But if not, we need her.
                   They'll never give Jaime back to us for
                   Sansa alone.

                                  JOFFREY
                        I think they might. They're weak.
                        They put too much value on their women.
      01:45:41
                                  CERSEI
                        We need to set our armies to the task
                        of finding her. Send out as many men
                        as we can. I'm sure if you asked,
                        grandfather...
                                  JOFFREY
                        A king does not ask. He commands. My
                        grandfather's stupidity in the field of
                        battle is the reason Robb Stark has
                        Uncle Jaime in the first place.
                                  CERSEI
                        His life is in danger.
                                  JOFFREY
                        We're at war. All our lives are in
                        danger.  I heard a disgusting lie about
                        Uncle Jaime.  And you.
                                  CERSEI
                        Our enemies will say anything to weaken
                        your claim to the throne.
                                  JOFFREY
                        It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
               Cersei smiles at Joffrey.
                                  CERSEI
                        Of course it is. No one believes this
                        fowl gossip.
                                  JOFFREY
                        Someone believes it. Father had other
                        children? Besides me and Tommen and

                         I'm asking if he fucked other women
                         when he grew tired of you? How many
                         bastards does he have running...
               Cersei slaps Joffrey across the face. The workmen stop and
               stare. Joffrey looks back at Cersei in shock. The workman
               quickly return to work.

                                  JOFFREY

                         death. You will never do it again.
                         Never.
               Joffrey walks away from Cersei.
                                  JOFFREY
                         That will be all, mother.

               A nude female whore sits on top of a nude male whore. She
               is feigning ecstasy as he hammers away at her. The two
               whores of streaming exaggerated moans. Ros stands in the
               room and stares of at them, irritated. Daisy stands beside
               her.
                                  ROS

                         ridiculous you sound? Ease into it.
                         Slowly. With passion.
               The female whore slows down and begins to moan again.
                                  ROS
                         Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes
                         on. Both of you are working tonight.
               The couple stops having sex. Ros walks out. Daisy
               follows. Ros continues her tour of the brothel with Daisy.

                         She pretends she doesn’t speak the
                         common tongue so that people will think
                         she's exotic. She grew up just down
                         the road in Flea Bottom.

                         She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid

               and drag a frightened man into the brothel. Janos nods to
               the cloaked men. They disperse through the brothel,
