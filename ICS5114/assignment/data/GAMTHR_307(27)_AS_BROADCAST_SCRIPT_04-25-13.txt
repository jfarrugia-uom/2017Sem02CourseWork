           Ygritte puts her bag on the rock and sits next to it.

           Jon Snow sits on the rock in front of Ygritte.

                   Most of the time, yes. 
      01:02:29      
                          YGRITTE 
                   How do the men holding the banners

                   They don't, really. 
           Ygritte takes off her shoe. 
                          JON SNOW (CONT'D) 
                   It's a great honor to carry your house

           Ygritte puts her shoe back on.

                   They help the men march.

                   Well, it's--it's the rhythm.

                   Oh, you mean... 
           Ygritte stands up and marches. 
                          YGRITTE (CONT'D) 
                   ...right foot, left foot, right foot, 
                   left foot, right foot? 
           Ygritte stops marching and turns to Jon Snow. 
                          YGRITTE (CONT'D) 
                   You need help remembering that?  When

           Ygritte takes her bag from the rock.

           Jon Snow stands up.

                   No, you're just gonna light the biggest

                   ...you don't. 
           Jon Snow turns around and faces Orell.

                          ORELL 
                   Cut her loose, too.  Do you see her 
                   sulking about it?  That's because she 
                   understands the way things are. 
           Jon Snow moves closer to Orell.

                   People work together when it suits 
                   them.  They're loyal when it suits 
                   them.  They love each other when it 
                   suits them.  And they kill each other 
                   when it suits them.  She knows that, 
                   you don't.  Which is why you'll never

           Edmure drinks from his cup.  Blackfish puts his cup on the 
           table, bows at Robb and walks out of the tent.  Catelyn follows

                   (heavy breathing) 
           Talisa and Robb are together naked on the bed.

           Robb gets out of the bed, takes his robe from the table and puts 
           it on.  Talisa is still lying on the bed. 
                          ROBB (CONT'D) 
                   If you don't put some clothes on, I 
                   can't promise I won't attack you again.

           Robb sits at the table and takes a cup from it.  Talisa takes 
           the writing board from the table.

           Robb stands up.

                   Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever 
                   wanted was to escape... 
           INT. KING'S LANDING - GAZEBO - DAY. 
            
           Margaery and Sansa are at the gazebo.  Sansa is crying. 
                          SANSA (CONT'D) 
                   ...to come here to the capital.  See 
                   the southern knights and their painted 
                   armor and King's Landing after dark--
                   all the candles burning in all those 
                   windows.  I'm stupid.  A stupid little 
                   girl with stupid dreams who never 
                   learns. 
      01:11:48      
                          MARGAERY 
                   Come on. 
           Margaery holds Sansa by the arm.  Sansa and Margaery stand up 
           and walk towards the door. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   Come walk with me.  I remember the 
                   first time I saw you in the throne 
                   room.  I'd never seen anyone who looked 
                   so unhappy. 
           Sansa and Margaery walks out of the gazebo.

           Sansa wipes her tears.                           
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   I want very much for you to be happy, 
                   Sansa, and so does my grandmother. 
           Margaery stops, turns to a bush and picks a flower. 
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   You would have been happy at 
                   Highgarden.  But women in our 
                   position... 
                    
           Margaery turns to Sansa. 
                    
                          MARGAERY (CONT'D) 
                   ...must make the best of our

                   He's a Lannister. 
      01:12:35      
                          MARGAERY 
                   Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't

      01:12:39      
                          SANSA 
                   I'm sorry.  Here I am complaining to

                   My son will be king.  Sons learn from 
                   their mothers.  I plan to teach mine a 
                   great deal.  And your son, if I'm not 
                   mistaken, your son might be the Lord of 
                   Casterly Rock and the North someday.  
                   What? 
           Sansa stops walking and turns to Margaery.  Margaery follows 
           her.

                   If it's the pain you're worried 
                   about... 
      01:13:17      
                          SANSA 
                   I'm not afraid of the pain.  Not after 
                   what Joffrey's done to me. 
      01:13:21      
                          MARGAERY 
                   What is it, then?  He's rather good-
                   looking even with the scar.  Especially 
                   with the scar. 
      01:13:30      
                          SANSA 
                   He's a dwarf.  And Loras--Loras. 
           Margaery holds Sansa's hand.

                   Some women like tall men.  Some like 
                   short men.  Some like hairy men.  Some 
                   like bald men.  Gentle men, rough men, 
                   ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls.  
                   Most women don't know what they like 
                   until they've tried it.  And, sadly, so 
                   many of us get to try so little before 
                   we're old and gray.  Tyrion may 
                   surprise you.  From what I've heard, 
                   he's quite experienced. 
      01:14:07      
                          SANSA 
                   And that's a good thing?

                          JOFFREY 
                   Yes.  I'd like a report on the meetings 
                   of my small council. 
      01:16:36      
                          TYWIN 
                   You're welcome to attend the meetings 
                   of your small council, Your Grace.  Any 
                   or all of them. 
      01:16:42      
                          JOFFREY 
                   I've been very busy.  Many important 
                   matters require... 
                    
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...a king's attention. 
      01:16:46      
                          TYWIN 
                   Of course 
      01:16:49      
                          JOFFREY 
                   You've been holding the council 
                   meetings in the Tower of the Hand 
                   instead of the small council chamber. 
      01:16:55      
                          TYWIN 
                   I have, yes. 
      01:16:59      
                          JOFFREY 
                   May I ask why? 
      01:17:01      
                          TYWIN 
                   The Tower of the Hand is where I work.

                   To walk from there to here would take    
                   time, time I could otherwise spend 
                   productively. 
      01:17:09      
                          JOFFREY 
                   So if I wanted to attend a council 
                   meeting, I would now have to climb... 
                    
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...all the stairs in the Tower of the 
                   Hand? 
           Tywin moves closer to Joffrey.  Joffrey leans back on his chair 
           feeling uneasy. 
            
      01:17:31 
                          TYWIN 
                   We could arrange to have you carried. 
      01:17:37      
                          JOFFREY 
                   Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the 
                   east and her dragons. 
      01:17:42      
                          TYWIN 
                   Where did you hear about this? 
      01:17:44      
                          JOFFREY 
                   Is it true? 
      01:17:47      
                          TYWIN 
                   Apparently so. 
      01:17:51

                   something about it?                      
      01:17:56      
                          TYWIN 
                   When I was Hand of the King under your 
                   father's predecessor, the skulls of all 
                   the Targaryen dragons were kept in this 
                   room.  The skull of the last of them... 
           Tywin points his finger at the floor. 
                          TYWIN (CONT'D) 
                   ...was right here.  It was the size of 
                   an apple. 
      01:18:15      
                          JOFFREY 
                   And the biggest was the size of a 
                   carriage. 
      01:18:18      
                          TYWIN 
                   Yes, and the creature to whom it 
                   belonged died 300 years ago.  
                   Curiosities on the far side of the 
                   world are no threat to us. 
      01:18:28      
                          JOFFREY (OS) 
                   But how do we know... 
                    
                          JOFFREY (CONT'D) 
                   ...these dragons are just curiosities 
                   and not the beasts that brought the 
                   whole world to heel? 
      01:18:35      
                          TYWIN 
                   Because we have been told as much by 
                   the many experts who serve the realm by 
                   counseling the king on matters about 
                   which he knows nothing.

      01:18:53      
                          TYWIN

                   You may approach. 
           Daenerys gestures Razdal to sit. 
                          DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                   Sit. 
           A woman places a chair in front of Razdal.  Missandei takes a 
           glass and a pitcher from the table and walks towards Razdal.  
           Razdal walks towards the chair and sits on it. 
            
      01:22:32 
                          MISSANDEI 
                   Will the noble lord take refreshment? 
           Razdal nods in agreement.  Missandei pours a drink into a glass.  
           Razdal drinks from his glass.  Missandei walks away.  Razdal 
           puts the glass on the ground. 
            
      01:22:47 
                          RAZDAL (to Daenerys) 
                   Ancient and glorious is Yunkai.  Our 
                   empire was old before dragons 
                   stirred... 
                    
                          RAZDAL (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...in old Valyria.  Many an army has 
                   broken against our walls. 
           Daenerys takes a piece of meat from the bowl. 
                          RAZDAL (CONT'D - OS) 
                   You shall find no easy conquest here, 
                   Khaleesi. 
           Daenerys throws the meat at the dragons.  The dragons fly in 
           front of her fighting for it.

           Razdal leans back on his chair feeling nervous.  The dragons 
           stop flying. 
            
      01:23:04 
                          DAENERYS 
                   Good.  My Unsullied need practice.  I 
                   was told to blood them early. 
      01:23:09      
                          RAZDAL 
                   If blood is your desire, blood shall 
                   flow.  But why?  'Tis true you have 
                   committed savageries in Astapor.  But 
                   the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous 
                   people. 
           Razdal claps his hands. 
                          RAZDAL (CONT'D) 
                   The wise masters... 
           The Yunkai's slaves are walking towards Daenerys carrying the 
           treasure chests. 
                          RAZDAL (CONT'D) 
                   ...of Yunkai have sent a gift for the 
                   silver queen. 
           The Yunkai slaves put the treasure chest beside Daenerys.  One 
           of the Yunkai slaves opens the chest.  The Yunkai slaves walk 
           away and then bow down.  Jorah and Daenerys look at each other. 
                          RAZDAL (CONT'D - OS) 
                   There is far more than this...

                   As I said, we are a generous people. 
                    
                          RAZDAL (CONT'D - OS)

           Daenerys looks at the Yunkai slaves who are kneeling. 
                          RAZDAL (CONT'D - OS) 
                   ...to conduct our affairs in peace.

                   We are not Astapor or Qarth.

                   We are Yunkai and we have powerful

                   I didn't ask for this marriage.  I 
                   didn't want it.

           Violet stands up and walks towards Myranda.  Theon looks at her.  
           Violet helps Myranda to stand.  She then undresses Myranda.  
           Myranda covers herself.

           Violet starts to undress.  Theon looks at her.  Myranda grabs  
           Theon's chin and turns his head toward her.

                   Should we see this cock everyone's

           Theon stands and rushes towards Reek.  Reek hits him with the 
           trumpet.

           Reek slides his hand down Violet’s bottom and squeezes it.  He 
           then walks closer to Theon and pulls out his dagger.  Theon 
           crawls away from Reek. 
                          REEK (CONT'D)

           Jon Snow grabs Ygritte by her coat and pulls her closer.

                   Six times in the last thousand years, a 
                   King-beyond-the-Wall has attacked the 
                   kingdoms.  Six times they failed. 
      01:43:02      
                          YGRITTE 
                   And how do you know that? 
      01:43:03      
                          JON SNOW 
                   Every boy in the North knows it.  We 
                   grow up learning it.  Where the battles 
                   were fought, the names of the heroes, 
                   who died where.  Six times you've 
                   invaded and six times you've failed.  
                   The seventh will be the same. 
      01:43:17      
                          YGRITTE 
                   Mance is different.

                          JON SNOW 
                   You don't have the discipline.  You 
                   don't have the training.  Your army is 
                   no army.  You don't know how to fight 
                   together. 
      01:43:25      
                          YGRITTE

                   I do.  I know it.  If you attack the     
                   Wall, you'll die.  All of you. 
           Ygritte moves closer to Jon Snow.

                   All of us. 
           Ygritte grabs Jon Snow and push him to a boulder.  She then 
           kisses him. 
                          YGRITTE (CONT'D) 
                   You're mine as I'm yours.  And if we 
                   die, we die.  But first we'll live.

                          JON SNOW 
                   Yes, first we'll live. 
           Jon Snow and Ygritte continue to kiss.

                   I had a man once.  A good man.  Bruni, 
                   his name was.

           EXT. RIVERLANDS - HILLSIDE - DAY. 
            
           Steelshanks and his men are camping at the foot of a hill.  
           Jaime and Qyburn are sitting on a rock.  Qyburn is tending on 
           Jaime's wounded arm.

                   What's the purpose of an arm with no

      01:48:32

                   Well, we've stymied the corruption.

                   Yes, we've stymied the corruption. 
           Qyburn pours the ointment onto his hand. 
                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   You're a learned man.

                   So why did the Citadel take your chain? 
           Qyburn covers the stump with a cloth. 
                          JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   Did you fondle one boy too many? 
      01:48:58      
                          QYBURN 
                   No, my lord.  That's not my weakness. 
           Qyburn secures the cloth with a bandage.

                          QYBURN 
                   Curiosity.  The only way to treat 
                   disease is to understand disease.  And 
                   the only way to understand it is to

                   You were in charge of the ravens at
