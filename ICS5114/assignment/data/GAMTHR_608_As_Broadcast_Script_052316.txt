                   Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp 
                   who killed his own king.  Born amongst 
                   lions, our curse from within.  I will 
                   slay him, I swear.  With noose or with 
                   knife, though it take me a fortnight, a 
                   moon or my life.

                   come home wherever home was that night 
                   stinking of some whore's perfume.  So

                          LADY CRANE (CONT’D) (OS) 
                   … and I'd put a hole in them.  And then 
                   I'd feel terrible, so I'd patch them 
                   up.  I got good at patching them up.

                   I never thought you'd find her.  I just 
                   assumed Sansa was dead.

                   Why would you assume that?

                          JAMIE

                   The Tullys are rebels because they're

                   Did I give you the impression that this 
                   was a negotiation?  It's not. 
    01:31:46 
     
                          EDMURE 
                   You understand.  On some level, you 
                   understand that you're an evil man. 
    01:31:51 
     
                          JAMIE 
                   I'll leave the judgments to the gods.

                   night.  How do you tell yourself that 
                   you're decent -- after everything that

                          JAMIE (CONT'D) (OS) 
                   … hated me just like you hate me.  But 
                   I didn't hate her. 
                    
                          JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                   I admired her.  Far more than her 
                   husband or her son. 
    01:33:13 
     
                          EDMURE 
                   Do you think I care whom you admire or

                          JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                   … because you're my prisoner.  You 
                   don't have a choice.  The love she had 
                   for her children … 
                    
                          JAMIE (CONT'D) (OS) 
                   … I was a little awed by it. 
                    
                          JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                   It reminded me of my sister.

                   I suppose all mothers do, but … 
     
                          JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                   … Catelyn and Cersei, there's a 
                   fierceness you don't often see.  They'd 
                   do anything to protect their babies.  
                   Start a war.  Burn cities to ash.  Free 
                   their worst enemies.  The things we do 
                   for love.

                   I love Cersei.  Now, you can laugh at 
                   that if you want.  You can sneer.  
                   Doesn't matter.  She needs me.  And to 
                   get back to her, I have to take
