                   I look forward to having  her back in my

                          RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                   And you're all fine-looking men.  My dogs 
                   are desperate to meet you.  I haven't fed 
                   them … 
                          RAMSAY (CONT’D) (OS)

                          RAMSAY (CONT’D) 
                   I wonder which part  they'll try first.

                          DAVOS 
                   That's not his way.   He knows the North  is 
                   watching.  If the other houses  sense 
                   weakness on his part,  they'll stop fearing 
                   him.  He can't have that.   Fear is his 
                   power. 
    01:16:21 
     
                          JON SNOW (OS) 
                   It's his weakness, too.   His men don't want 
                   to fight for him.   They're forced to fight  
                   for him. If they feel  the tide turning …

                          TORMUND (OS) 
                   It's not his men that worry me.   
                          TORMUND (CONT’D) 
                   It's his horses.  I know what mounted  
                   knights can do to us.   You and Stannis cut 
                   through us like piss through snow.

                   We're digging trenches  all along our 
                   flanks.  They won't be able  to hit us the 
                   way that Stannis hit you, in a double 
                   envelopment.

                   Good. 
    01:17:00 
     
                          DAVOS 
                   It's crucial that we let  them charge at us.  They've got 
                   the numbers, we need the patience.

                   If you had asked for my advice earlier,  I would have told 
                   you not to attack Winterfell  until we had a larger force  …

                          TORMUND (OS) 
                   I've never seen these  Bolton fuckers fight.   And they've 
                   never seen the free folk fight,  so, yes, there's hope.

                   You want to avenge  your king, don't you?

                   It wasn't the Boltons  defeated Stannis.   It was Stannis 
                   himself.  I loved the man.  He lifted me up and made me 
                   something.  But he had demons  in his skull whispering  foul 
                   things. 
    01:21:02 
     
                          TORMUND 
                   You saw these demo ns? 
    01:21:04 
     
                          DAVOS 
                   What?   
                          DAVOS (CONT’D) (OS) 
                   No … 
                          DAVOS (CONT’D) 
                   … it's a manner of speaking.  Not actual demons.  
    01:21:21 
     
                          TORMUND 
                   Oh.   
                    
                          TORMUND (CONT’D) (OS) 
                   Well, you loved that cunt Stannis  and I loved the man he 
                   burned. 
                    
                          TORMUND (CONT’D) 
                   Mance didn't have  demons in his skull.   He didn't torch 
                   people or listen to some red witch.    
                          TORMUND (CONT’D) (OS) 
                   I believed in him.   I thought he was the man to lead us  
                   through the … 
                          TORMUND (CONT’D)  
                   … Long Night.  But I was wrong just like you. 
    01:21:45 
     
                          DAVOS (OS) 
                   Maybe that was our mistake,  believing in 
                   kings. 
    01:21:43

                          TORMUND (OS) 
                   I need a good drink  to help me sleep the 
                   night before a fight.   
                          TORMUND (CONT’D)  
                   You want some?  I have a jug of sour goat's 
                   milk … 
                          TORMUND (CONT’D) (OS) 
                   … stronger than any of that  grape water you 
                   southern twats like sucking on.  
    01:22:11 
     
                          DAVOS (OS) 
                   No, thanks.  It does sound delicious,  but I 
                   better keep a clear head.   I can never 
                   sleep the night before a battle.  
    01:22:18 
     
                          TORMUND (OS) 
                   So what do you do all night? 
    01:22:20 
     
                          DAVOS  
                   I walk.  Think and walk.   
                          DAVOS (CONT’D) (OS) 
                   Think and walk until I'm far enough  away

               Melisandre is deep in thought.  Jon Snow talks to

                   My lady.

                   You weren't at the war council.

                          MELISANDRE (OS) 
                   I'm not a soldier.  
    01:22:58 
     
                          JON SNOW  
                   Any advice? 
    01:23:01 
     
                          MELISANDRE 
                   Don't lose. 
    01:23:09 
     
                          JON SNOW           
                   If I do, if I fall -- don't bring me back.

                          JON SNOW 
                   You're in my camp.   I'm the commander.  
    01:23:24 
     
                          MELISANDRE 
                   I serve the Lord of Light.   I do what he 
                   commands. 
    01:23:30 
     
                          JON SNOW 
                   How do you know what he commands?  
    01:23:32 
     
                          MELISANDRE 
                   I interpret his signs  -- as well as I can.   
                          MELISANDRE (CONT’D) (OS) 
                   If the Lord didn't want  me to bring you 
                   back, how did I bring you back?    
                          MELISANDRE (CONT’D) 
                   I have no power.  Only what he gives me  and 
                   he gave me you. 
    01:23:43 
     
                          JON SNOW 
                   Why? 
    01:23:48 
     
                          MELISANDRE

                   he brought you here  to die again.

                   Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, 
                   you see.  You won't get one  without the
