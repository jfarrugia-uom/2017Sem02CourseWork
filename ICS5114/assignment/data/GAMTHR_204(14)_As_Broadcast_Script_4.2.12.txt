           NIGHT. 
            
           It’s raining and two Lannister guards watch over 
           the camp’s horses.   
                       
                          LANNISTER #1 
                   Well it’s got to be the Mountain.  He’s 
                   the biggest.  He’s the strongest. 
 
           Lannister #2 is sitting by the fire while 
           Lannister #1 is standing staying warm.   
         
                          LANNISTER #2 
                   Bulls are bigger than lions.  Doesn’t 
                   mean I’d pick a bull in a fight. 
                
                          LANNISTER #1 
                   Well if the bull had fangs and claws I 
                   would.  Alright. 
                    
           Lannister #1 sits down next to Lannister #2.

                          LANNISTER #2 
                   Loras Tyrell.  He’s prettier than the 
                   Queen.   
                
                          LANNISTER #1 
                   I don’t care about pretty.  He’s better 
                   with a sword   than any of ‘em.

           The horses start making noises and seem to be 
           bothered by something.  Lannister #2 stands up and 
           looks over at them.

                   They’re horses.  They get spooked by 
                   their own shadows.

           One of the horses is noticeably upset.

                   Did you hear that?

           Lannister #2 puts his hand on his sword.

           Lannister #1 gets up and appears aggravated.  He 
           looks out into the night. Both guardsmen become 
           very concerned.  Lannister #1 starts to walk 
           towards the horses with his hand on his sword.  
           Then Lannister #2 farts really loud.

           The horses are still visibly upset and Lannister 
           #1 is still listening to the night.

           Rennick is laying dead on the ground.  Men scream 
           in pain from their wounds.  Robb Stark, Roose 
           Bolton and several other officers walk through the

                   Five Lannisters dead for every one of

           A soldier rides a horse carrying a flag through 
           the battlefield which is loaded with wounded 
           soldiers.   
            
           Talisa sends off a cart carrying away the 
           Lannister prisoner with his amputated leg wrapped 
           tight with bandages.  Robb who was on the other 
           side of the cart turns around to look at Talisa.  
           They exchange a look and then Talisa goes to clean 
           up her things.  Robb walks over to her.

                   never held a spear before they shoved

           draws his sword while Joffrey and all the people 
           watch.  He hits the back of her legs with the 
           sword.  Sansa falls to the ground.  Joffrey 
           stands.

                   Meryn, my lady is overdressed.  Unburden 
                   her. 
                    
           Meryn cuts Sansa’s clothes off her and showing her 
           undergarments.  Hound is not happy with the 
           events.   
            
                          JOFFREY 
                   If you want Robb Stark to hear us we’re 
                   going to have to speak louder!   
                    
           Meryn draws his sword as Sansa sits and cries.  
           Meryn is about to hit her when Tyrion walks in and 
           interrupts.

           The Hound removes his cloak and wraps it around 
           Sansa.   
            
                          JOFFREY 
                   I’m punishing her.

                   King can do as he likes!   
            
           Tyrion approaches Joffrey who is sitting on the 
           throne.

           Sansa is wary of him but takes his hand and gets 
           up.  Joffrey jumps out of his seat.  Tyrion and 
           Sansa walk out of the Throne Room.  Joffrey 
           watches them go, glaring at them.

           Sansa continues walking out of the room as Tyrion 
           stops.  The handmaidens follow behind her.

           in his bed.  He stands staring at them dumbly.

           Joffrey is now pointing the crossbow at the girls.  
            
                          JOFFREY 
                   Oh I want him to find out.  You will 
                   bring her to his chambers when you’re 
                   finished, and show him what you’ve done.  
                   Or the same thing will happen to you.   
            
           Ros looks at the scepter and then at Daisy.  
           Joffrey is sitting in a chair at his desk with the 
           crossbow pointed at the girls.     
                    
                          JOFFREY 
                   Begin.       
                    
           Ros doesn’t want to do this.  But she’s not a 
           martyr.  Daisy cries in fear and puts her head 
           down.  Ros hits Daisy with the scepter and Daisy 
           screams in pain.   
            
                          DAISY

           Joffrey watches with his crossbow aimed at them.   
            
                          JOFFREY 
                   Harder!     
                    
           EXT. RENLY’S TENT - DUSK. 
            
           Men ride into camp on horseback.  Littlefinger 
           waits outside the tent with two Guardsmen watching 
           him.  Renly finally arrives.

                   waiting long. 
                                                 
           Renly walks past with his men as Littlefinger 
           gives him a smile.  Renly knows he has.

           INT. STORMLANDS – RENLY’S TENT – CONTINUOUS. 
            
           Renly sits down and pulls off his gloves and 
           Littlefinger is walking in to the tent.   
            
                          RENLY 
                   So now you do the Lannisters bidding, is 
                   that it?  Tell me was my brother’s body 
                   even cold before you secured your newest 
                   patron?     
                    
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   I am a practical man.     
                    
                          RENLY 
                   Just not a loyal one.     
            
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   And who would you have me be loyal to, 
                   your brother’s corpse? 
                    
           Renly gets up from his stool and approaches 
           Littlefinger.   
                
                          RENLY 
                   I don’t like you Lord Baelish.  I don’t 
                   like your face.  I don’t like the words 
                   that come oozing out of your mouth.  I 
                   don’t want you in my tent one minute 
                   more than necessary.  So tell me, why 
                   are you here? 
                    
           Littlefinger doesn’t want to talk in front of Brienne.  
            
                          RENLY 
                   You can trust Brienne.  Her loyalty 
                   comes without charge.  
                    
           Renly turns and walks away from Littlefinger to go get 
           an apple from the table.     
                
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   You still have many friends at Court 
                   your Grace.  Many who believe Ned Stark 
                   erred by not supporting your claim.

                   numbers.   
                    
           Renly sits down in a chair with his apple.   
            
                          JOFFREY 
                   You know I’m marching on King’s Landing. 
                   When I take the Throne you hope to 
                   retain your position and your head.   
                    
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   I would give priority to my head.  I 
                   understand that you don’t like me and 
                   while that saddens me greatly I did not 
                   come here today seeking your affection.  
                   When you march on King’s Landing you may 
                   find yourself facing a protacted siege 
                   or, open gates.   
                    
           Renly considers this proposition.   
                    
           EXT. STORMLANDS – RENLY’S ENCAMPMENT – NIGHT. 
            
           Littlefinger is standing next to a fire and sees 
           Renly’s bride, Margaery Tyrell approaching with her 
           brother, Ser Loras.  Loras whispers something to 
           Margaery, nods then walks away.  Margaery continues 
           walking past the fire.     
            
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   Your Grace.   
                    
                          MARGAERY 
                   Lord Baelish.     
                    
           Littlefinger follows her.   
            
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   All of these tents look the same to me.  
                   [LAUGH] Would you be so kind ...

                   It would be my pleasure.  It took me 
                   weeks to learn my way around the camp.  
                   Twice I walked in on Officers in stages 
                   of undress.  And the moment I learn 
                   which tent is mine, we’re on the move 
                   again.

                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   Your tent?  Not our tent.  The King 
                   snores perhaps?  Or simply prefers 
                   solitude.  The pressures of command, no 
                   doubt.  Four kings vying for the throne.     
            
                          MARGAERY 
                   I am not tutored in warfare but basic 
                   arithmetic favors the side with the 
                   greater numbers.     
                    
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   If war were arithmetic, the 
                   mathematicians would rule the world.  I 
                   did notice your brother entering his 
                   Grace’s tent just now.       
                    
                          MARGAERY 
                   The place of a kingsguard is by the 
                   King’s side.     
                    
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   And on the night of your wedding, who 
                   was by the King’s side then?   
                    
                          MARGAERY 
                   You seem quite interested in our 
                   marriage.     
                    
           Littlefinger stops.   
                    
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   Your marriage is quite interesting.  Not 
                   only to me but to the realm.     
                    
           Margaery stops and faces Littlefinger.   
            
                          LITTLEFINGER 
                   The marriage of a wealthy girl always 
                   breeds interest if nothing else.

                   That is sad.  Though perhaps it’s for 
                   the best.  The whole notion of marriage 
                   seems to confuse you.  So allow me to 
                   explain.  My husband is my King and my 
                   King is my husband.  Here is your tent 
                   Lord Baelish.  Good night.   
                    
           Margaery turns and leave as Littlefinger bows to 
           her.

           Kovarro rides a horse through the desert.  Dany

           The Tickler is sitting across from the victim as 
           Polliver is standing in front of him.  Tickler 
           nods to Polliver.  Polliver picks up a bucket and 
           walks over to a box.  While the other prisoners 
           watching including Arya and Gendry, Polliver 
           removes a rat from the box and throws it in the 
           bucket.  The victim is really freaked out now.

                   I am simply a trader of spices.  But we

                   alive has seen a living dragon. Some of 
                   my more skeptical friends refuse to 
                   believe your children even exist.  All 
                   we ask is the chance to see for 
                   ourselves.

           Tickler nods to Polliver.  Arya and Hot Pie watch 
           as Polliver removes a rat from the box and places 
           it in a bucket.  Polliver straps the bucket on to 
           Gendry’s abdomen.   
 
           Arya and the other prisoners hear someone coming 
           on horseback.  Tywin Lannister rides in to town 
           with Officers and Lannister Guards.  Tywin rides 
           over to Gendry strapped in the chair.

                   We weren’t expecting you ‘til tomorrow 
                   Lord Tywin. 
                    
           Tywin dismounts his horse and comes over to the 
           pen and Gendry. 
            
                          TYWIN  
                   [LAUGH] Evidently not.  Why are these 
                   prisoners not in their cells?

                   These lot won’t be here long.  Don’t 
                   need no permanent place.  After we 
                   interrogate them we usually just ... 
                    
           Tywin looks over the prisoners.  Arya looks down 
           and tries not to be noticed.     
            
                          TYWIN 
                   Are we so well manned that we can afford 
                   to discard young able bodies and skilled 
                   laborers? 
                    
           Tywin walks over to the Tickler and Gendry.   
            
                          TYWIN 
                   You.  Do you have a trade?     
                    
                          GENDRY 
                   Smith, my Lord.     
                    
           Arya sees Polliver’s knife in its case.  Tywin 
           looks at Tickler and Polliver disgusted.  Polliver 
           looks over and see Arya staring at him.   
                        
                          POLLIVER 
                   What you looking at?  Kneel.       
                    
           Polliver draws his sword.

                   You’ll do no such thing.  This one’s a

           Tywin begins to leave.

           Tywin stops and looks back at Arya.

           There’s a knock at the door.  Tyrion opens the

                   If my sister was so concerned for 
                   Pycelle, I would have thought she’d come 
                   herself.  Instead she sends you.  What 
                   am I to make of that?   
                
           Tyrion walks over to the table to sit down as

                   No. I think not. 
                    
                          LANCEL 
                   My lord?   
                    
    [MUSIC IN] 
                          TYRION 
                   You heard me.  My father told you to 
                   obey my sister.  Obey her.  Stay close 
                   to her side, keep her trust.  Pleasure 
                   her whenever she requires.  No one ever 
                   need know as long as you keep faith with 
                   me. 
                    
           Lancel considers what Tyrion is offering.     
            
                          TYRION 
                   I want to know what Cersei is doing.  
                   Where she goes, who she sees, what they 
                   talk of, everything.  And you will tell 
                   me.    
                    
    01:42:50 
     
                          LANCEL 
                   Yes my Lord, I will.  I swear it.  As 
                   you command.   
                    
           Lancel looks down.  Tyrion claps and grabs Lancel 
           to help him up. 
            
            
                          TYRION 
                   Oh rise!  Rise.  Let us drink to our 
                   understanding.  Oh you don’t have a cup.  
                   Oh well.   
                    
           Lancel starts to leave but stops at the door.   
            
                          TYRION 
                   Smile cousin.  My sister is a beautiful 
                   woman and it’s all for the good of the 
                   realm.  Go back and tell her that I beg 
                   her forgiveness, that I want no more 
                   conflict between us and that henceforth 
                   I shall do nothing without her consent.

                   Oh.  I’ll give her Pycelle.   
                    
                          LANCEL 
                   You will? 
                    
                          TYRION 
                   Yes.  I’ll release him in the morning.  
                   Cersei can keep him as a pet if she 
                   wants but I will not have him on the 
                   council.  I could swear that I had not 
                   harmed a single hair on his head but 
                   that would not strictly speaking be 
                   true.   
                    
           Lancel looks at Tyrion shocked.  Tyrion shuts the 
           door in his face. Lancel walks away.   
            
           EXT. BLACK BETHA - DECK - NIGHT. 
            
           Stannis stands on deck of a boat looking out at 
           the bay.  Davos approaches.

                          DAVOS 
                   Your Grace? 
                    
           Stannis turns to Davos and the men exchange a 
           look.   
            
                          STANNIS 
                   Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?  
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   My life’s been good since you hacked ‘em 
                   off, your Grace.  And it’s four less 
                   fingernails to clean. 
                    
                          STANNIS 
                   Fewer. 
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   Pardon?   
                    
                          STANNIS 
                   Four fewer fingernails to clean.  I 
                   never understood why you had to wear 
                   them.

                          DAVOS 
                   Reminds me of where I come from and 
                   where I am now.  [SIGH] Reminds me of 
                   your justice.  It was an honest 
                   punishment.  And you were good with the 
                   cleaver.   
                    
                          STANNIS 
                   You were a hero and a smuggler.  A good 
                   act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad 
                   to good.   
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   A lesson I tried to teach my son.   
                    
                          STANNIS 
                   Hmmm. Does he listen?   
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   To me?  Gods no.  But if your red woman 
                   told him to leap from the crow’s nest 
                   ... 
                    
                          STANNIS 
                   She has a name.  I trust you haven’t 
                   forgotten your smuggler’s tricks.

                          STANNIS

                   Cleaner ways.   
                    
                          STANNIS 
                   Cleaner ways don’t win wars.   
       
           Davos nods and leaves Stannis on the deck.   
                           
           EXT. STORMLANDS – BEACH –SHIPBREAKER BAY - NIGHT. 
            
           Davos rows Melisandre in a tiny skiff.  She holds 
           a lantern.   
       
    01:45:54 
       
                          MELISANDRE 
                   Are you afraid, Onion Knight?   
                           
                          DAVOS 
                   Someone once told me the night is dark 
                   and full of terrors. 
                           
                          MELISANDRE 
                   You’ve carried more unpleasant cargo in 
                   your time.  Are you a good man Ser Davos 
                   Seaworth? 
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   I’d say my parts are mixed my Lady.  
                   Good and bad.   
                    
                          MELISANDRE 
                   If half an onion is black with rot it’s 
                   a rotten onion.  A man is good or he is 
                   evil.   
                    
                          DAVOS 
                   And which are you? 
                    
                          MELISANDRE 
                   Oh good.  I am a knight myself, of 
                   sorts.  A champion of light and life.

                   [SIGH] Well that must be very nice for 
                   you.   
                    
           They reach the shore and Davos jumps out and pulls 
           the boat on shore.  Davos unloads the boat.

             Davos helps Melisandre out of the boat.

                      It’s strange that this Lord of Light 
                      asked you to work in the shadows.  
                       
                               MELISANDRE 
                      Shadows cannot live in the dark Ser 
                      Davos.  They are servants of the light.  
                      The children of fire.  And the brighter 
                      the flame, the darker they are.   
                       
             Davos raises his lantern and sees bars at the back 
             of the cave.

             Melisandre is undressing.  Davos turns around to
