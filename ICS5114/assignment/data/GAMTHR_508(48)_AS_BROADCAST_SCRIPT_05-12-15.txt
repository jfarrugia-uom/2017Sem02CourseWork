          INT. DANY'S AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY 
                                        
          Daenerys Targaryen sits on a platform in the chamber, with Missandei at her side. Jorah Mormont and 
          Tyrion Lannister stand below and before her. They are handcuffed. 
                                        
                           JORAH 
                       Your Grace, I want to say--

                          DAENERYS 
                         You will not speak. 
    01:02:10:18                         
                                        
          Dany addresses Tyrion.        
                                        
                          DAENERYS 
                   How do I know you are who you say you are? 
                                        
    01:02:12:20                         
                           TYRION 
                        If only I were otherwise. 
                                        
    01:02:15:11                         
                          DAENERYS 
                  If you are Tyrion Lannister, why shouldn't I kill you 
                                        
                                        
    01:02:18:06                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                   to pay your family back for what it did to mine? 
                                        
    01:02:20:17                         
                                        
          Tyrion speaks in an even voice, without moving. 
                                        
                           TYRION 
                    You want revenge against the Lannisters? 
                                        
    01:02:23:11                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     I killed my mother Joanna Lannister 
                                        
    01:02:25:24                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                        on the day I was born. 
                                        
    01:02:27:16                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                 I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bolt to the heart. 
                                        
    01:02:31:11                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time. 
                                        
    01:02:33:23                         
                                        
          Dany responds dryly.          
                                        
                          DAENERYS 
                    So I should welcome you into my service 
                                        
    01:02:35:28                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                  because you murdered members of your own family? 
                                        
    01:02:39:14                         
                                        
          Tyrion looks surprised.       
                                        
                           TYRION 
                         Into your service? 
                                        
    01:02:42:03                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     Your Grace, we have only just met. 
                                        
                                        
                                        
    01:02:45:00                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   It's too soon to know if you deserve my service. 
                                        
    01:02:47:09                         
                                        
          Dany sits with her hands folded. She speaks quietly. 
                                        
                          DAENERYS 
                    If you'd rather return to the fighting pits, 
                                        
    01:02:50:09                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                         just say the word. 
                                        
    01:02:54:20                         
                                        
          Tyrion pauses for a moment. Then he speaks again. His voice is brisk. 
                                        
                           TYRION 
                    When I was a young man, I heard a story 
                                        
    01:02:57:04                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. 
                                        
    01:03:00:20                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     She had no wealth, no lands, no army, 
                                        
    01:03:02:29                         
                                        
          Dany listens.                 
                                        
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                    only a name and a handful of supporters, 
                                        
    01:03:06:01                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
            most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. 
                                        
                                        
                                        
    01:03:09:22                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                  They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, 
                                        
    01:03:12:14                         
                                        
          Jorah listens as well.        
                                        
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                 often hours ahead of the men who'd been sent to kill her. 
                                        
    01:03:15:13                         
                                        
          Dany listens without showing what she is thinking. 
                                        
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
              She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world 
                                        
    01:03:18:27                         
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                      and that appeared to be that. 
                                        
    01:03:21:07                         
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                       And then a few years later, 
                                        
    01:03:23:02                         
                                        
          Tyrion frowns slightly.       
                                        
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     the most well-informed person I knew 
                                        
    01:03:25:12                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                  told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies 
                                        
    01:03:28:10                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                had somehow acquired all three in a very short span of time, 
                                        
                                        
                                        
    01:03:31:20                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       along with three dragons. 
                                        
    01:03:33:19                         
                                        
          Dany continues to listen.     
                                        
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                       He thought she was our best, 
                                        
    01:03:35:26                         
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                     last chance to build a better world. 
                                        
    01:03:40:04                         
                                        
          Tyrion and Jorah stand side by side.  
                                        
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                  I thought you were worth meeting at the very least. 
                                        
    01:03:42:23                         
                          DAENERYS 
                      And why are you worth meeting? 
                                        
    01:03:44:07                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                   Why should I spend my time listening to you? 
                                        
    01:03:46:06                         
                           TYRION 
                 Because you cannot build a better world on your own. 
                                        
    01:03:49:03                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
             You have no one at your side who understands the land you want to rule. 
                                        
    01:03:52:26                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   The strengths and weaknesses of the houses 
                                        
                                        
    01:03:54:25                         
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                     that will either join or oppose you. 
                                        
    01:03:56:06                         
                                        
          Dany speaks firmly.           
                                        
                          DAENERYS 
                       I will have a very large army 
                                        
    01:03:59:01                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                        and very large dragons. 
                                        
    01:04:00:19                         
                          TYRION - OS 
                   Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. 
                                        
    01:04:04:12                         
                                        
          Tyrion's voice is persuasive.  
                                        
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     When I served as Hand of the King, 
                                        
    01:04:06:12                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question 
                                        
    01:04:08:26                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                  preferred torturing animals to leading his people. 
                                        
    01:04:12:14                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       I could do an even better job 
                                        
    01:04:14:12                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                      advising a ruler worth the name. 
                                        
                                        
    01:04:16:24                         
                                        
          Dany looks down at Tyrion.    
                                        
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                      If that is indeed what you are. 
                                        
    01:04:19:07                         
                          DAENERYS 
                       So you want to advise me? 
                                        
    01:04:23:17                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                          Very well. 
                                        
    01:04:27:00                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                    What would you have me do with him? 
                                        
    01:04:30:15                         
                                        
          Tyrion listens carefully.     
                                        
                       DAENERYS (OS - CONT'D) 
                    I swore I would kill him if he ever returned. 
                                        
    01:04:34:02                         
                           TYRION 
                           I know. 
                                        
    01:04:39:09                         
                                        
          Tyrion takes a step toward Dany. For the first time, Jorah glances at him. 
                                        
                          DAENERYS 
               Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises? 
                                        
    01:04:46:08                         
                           TYRION 
                Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, 
                                        
                                        
                                        
    01:04:49:06                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       he is no longer that man. 
                                        
    01:04:52:04                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                    I can't remember ever seeing a sane man 
                                        
    01:04:54:07                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. 
                                        
    01:04:56:25                         
                                        
          Dany listens.                 
                                        
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                   He claims he would kill for you and die for you 
                                        
    01:04:59:21                         
                                        
          Jorah looks at Tyrion, then at Dany.  
                                        
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                and nothing I ever witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. 
                                        
    01:05:06:16                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       And yet he did betray you. 
                                        
    01:05:21:01                         
                                        
           Tyrion walks closer to Dany. A guard makes a gesture with his spear. Dany holds up a hand to stop him. 
                                        
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                  Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayal? 
                                        
    01:05:23:25                         
                                        
          Dany's voice is hard.         
                                        
                          DAENERYS 
                            Yes. 
    01:05:26:01                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                        Many opportunities. 
                                        
    01:05:28:03                         
                                        
          Jorah looks down.             
                                        
                          TYRION - OS 
                          And did he? 
                                        
    01:05:30:21                         
                          DAENERYS 
                       No, not until forced to do so. 
                                        
    01:05:39:26                         
                           TYRION 
                         He worships you. 
                                        
    01:05:41:28                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                      He is in love with you, I think. 
                                        
    01:05:44:23                         
                                        
          Dany listens. Jorah looks at her.  
                                        
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                     But he did not trust you with the truth. 
                                        
    01:05:46:29                         
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                      An unpleasant truth to be sure, 
                                        
    01:05:48:15                         
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                     but one of great significance to you. 
                                        
    01:05:51:06                         
                                        
          Dany listens.                 
                                        
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him. 
                                        
    01:05:55:09                         
                          DAENERYS 
                        So I should kill him? 
                                        
    01:05:58:09                         
                           TYRION 
                     A ruler who kills those devoted to her 
                                        
    01:06:00:21                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     is not a ruler who inspires devotion. 
                                        
    01:06:03:13                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   And you're going to need to inspire devotion, 
                                        
    01:06:05:18                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                a lot of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. 
                                        
    01:06:11:01                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                  But you cannot have him by your side when you do. 
                                        
    01:06:19:18                         
                                        
          Dany appears to be looking at nothing as she speaks. 
                                        
                          DAENERYS 
                      Remove Ser Jorah from the city. 
                                        
          Jorah's lips part, but he does not speak. He looks at Dany, then allows the guards to escort him out. 
          Tyrion and Dany watch him go.

          Jorah rolls up his sleeve and looks at the diseased place on his arm. He walks away.

          The door to Cersei's cell opens. Septa Unella walks into the cell, carrying a bucket. The door shuts.

          Unella walks to Cersei, who is huddled on the floor. She fills a dipper with water from the bucket and 
          extends it to Cersei. Cersei places her hand on the dipper.

          Cersei looks up at Unella.    
                                        
                           CERSEI 
                          I meant it.

          Unella hits Cersei across the face. Cersei winces. Unella leaves.

          Cersei turns her head to the side, grasping her knees.

          Arya Stark speaks quietly.    
                                        
                           ARYA 
                      My name is Lanna. I'm an orphan.

          Sitting and listening to Arya is Jaqen H'Ghar. He is holding a wooden rod across his knees. 
                                        
                        ARYA (OS - CONT'D) 
                    When I was eight, I begged enough money 
                                        
    01:08:11:23                         
                        ARYA (OS - CONT'D) 
                      to buy my first bucket of oysters. 
                                        
    01:08:13:25                         
                         ARYA (CONT'D) 
                I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy two more.

          A closeup of oysters in buckets. Then it is seen that the buckets are loaded in a wheelbarrow, which is 
          being pushed by Arya.

                          ARYA (V.O.) 
                    It took a while, but I finally saved enough 
                                        
    01:08:23:19                         
                                        
          Arya pushes the wheelbarrow through the street; around her, people are lively and talking. 
                                        
                        ARYA (V.O. - CONT'D) 
                       to buy myself an oyster cart.

                     I make my way down to the canals.

                     I pass the fish mongers and the bakers.

          A young woman is seen, carrying a basket on her hip. Arya turns and smiles at her. She places oysters 
          in the woman's basket. 
                                        
                        ARYA (V.O. - CONT'D) 
                         I usually see Lhara,

                   my first customer of the day on her way home. 
                                        
          Lhara hands Arya coins.

                    Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--

    01:09:21:17                         
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                      If he knew what she would see, 
                                        
    01:09:23:00                         
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                     there would be no reason to send her. 
                                        
    01:09:25:13                         
                           ARYA 
                       Oysters, clams, and cockles! 
                                        
    01:09:32:16                         
          ( laughs )                    
                                        
    01:09:45:09                         
                           ARYA 
                       Oysters, clams, and cockles! 
                                        
    01:09:56:07                         
                                        
          The Thin Man is sitting at a table covered with coins and papers. 
                                        
                           ARYA 
                       Oysters, clams, and cockles! 
                                        
    01:09:59:21                         
                          THIN MAN 
                         Your oysters fresh? 
                                        
    01:10:02:26                         
                                        
          Arya stops to reply.          
                                        
                           ARYA 
                         Best in the city. 
                                        
    01:10:04:18                         
                          THIN MAN 
                    You wouldn't lie to an old man, would you? 
                                        
    01:10:19:15                         
                                        
          Arya splits open an oyster and hands it to him. He eats it. 
                                        
                        THIN MAN (CONT'D) 
                            Mm. 
                                        
    01:10:21:20                         
                        THIN MAN (CONT'D) 
                     Very nice. Give me four with vinegar. 
                                        
          Arya turns to prepare the oysters, and the Captain walks up to the Thin Man. He sets some papers and 
          a bag of money on the table. 
                                        
    01:10:28:26                         
                           CAPTAIN 
                        It's my 18th voyage. 
                                        
    01:10:30:22                         
                                        
          The Thin Man begins paging through the papers. 
                                        
                        CAPTAIN (OS - CONT'D) 
                  Returned from all of them without a scratch on me. 
                                        
    01:10:39:27                         
                                        
          The Thin Man studies the final paper, then shakes his head. 
                                        
                          THIN MAN 
                          Can't do it. 
                                        
          Arya overhears the conversation. She lifts a bottle and tips liquid onto the oysters. 
                                        
    01:10:41:17                         
                          CAPTAIN - OS 
                       Please, I've three children… 
                                        
    01:10:44:15                         
                        CAPTAIN (OS - CONT'D) 
                          Without me... 
                                        
    01:10:46:03                         
                                        
          The Captain pushes the bag of money closer to the Thin Man. 
                                        
                         CAPTAIN (CONT'D) 
                       Here, take it. You have to. 
                                        
    01:10:47:22                         
                         CAPTAIN (CONT'D) 
                         I've three children. 
                                        
          Arya listens as the Captain speaks desperately, and the man comes to remove him. 
                                        
    01:10:49:13                         
                        CAPTAIN (CONT'D) MAN 
                         What will they do?    
                           Come on. 
                                        
    01:10:50:26                         
                        CAPTAIN (OS - CONT'D) 
                       They've nothing without me. 
                                        
    01:10:52:18                         
                        CAPTAIN (OS - CONT'D) 
                        Please, you have to! 
                                        
          Arya turns to watch as two men drag the Captain away and out of sight. 
                                        
    01:10:54:06                         
                         CAPTAIN (CONT'D) 
                      Please, you don't understand! 
                                        
    01:10:56:17                         
                        CAPTAIN (OS - CONT'D) 
                           Please! 
                                        
          The Thin Man hands Arya a coin. She turns away without speaking. 
                                        
    01:11:04:08                         
                          JAQEN - VO 
                        The man is a gambler. 
                                        
    01:11:07:23                         
          INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE - ATRIUM - LATER 
                                        
          Jaqen and Arya are standing near the pool. 
                                        
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                       He wages that a sailor's ship 
                                        
    01:11:09:15                         
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                      will make it to its destination. 
                                        
    01:11:12:20                         
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                     It is a strange wager for the captain. 
                                        
    01:11:15:08                         
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                      He only wins if he loses his life. 
                                        
    01:11:19:24                         
                           ARYA 
                 So why would a captain make the wager in the first place? 
                                        
    01:11:24:19                         
                                        
          Jaqen looks at her. He sounds surprised. 
                                        
                           JAQEN 
                     A girl tells a man that she has seen. 
                                        
    01:11:29:29                         
                                        
          Arya thinks for a moment.     
                                        
                           ARYA 
                         If the captain dies, 
                                        
    01:11:32:03                         
                         ARYA (CONT'D) 
                    the thin man pays his family a lot of money. 
                                        
    01:11:36:25                         
                           JAQEN 
                     But perhaps the gambler loses his bet 
                                        
    01:11:39:26                         
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                   and decides he does not have to pay after all. 
                                        
    01:11:42:03                         
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                     A destitute woman and her small child, 
                                        
    01:11:44:20                         
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
               what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? 
                                        
    01:11:50:09                         
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                     To whom can they turn for recourse? 
                                        
    01:11:52:26                         
                                        
          Arya turns to look at the Waif.  
                                        
          ( whispering prayer )         
                                        
                                        
    01:11:58:27                         
                                        
          Arya looks back at Jaqen.     
                                        
                           ARYA 
                        The Many-Faced God. 
                                        
          Jaqen nods slightly.          
                                        
    01:12:02:16                         
                         ARYA (CONT'D) 
                 You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks. 
                                        
    01:12:04:29                         
                           JAQEN 
               A man had no idea what a girl would see and what she would not. 
                                        
    01:12:10:02                         
                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                    A girl named Lanna will return to the docks. 
                                        
    01:12:13:02

                       She will watch the gambler.

          Arya listens intently.        
                                        
                        JAQEN (OS - CONT'D) 
              She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.

                           ARYA 
                         And then what? 
                                        
    01:12:20:11                         
                                        
          Jaqen holds out a small bottle.  
                                        
                           JAQEN 
                        A gift for the thin man. 
                                        
          Arya takes the bottle, looking distressed. She turns and leaves. The Waif walks up to Jaqen. 
                                        
    01:12:44:02

                         She's not ready.

                      Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not. 
                                        
    01:12:49:08                         
                           WAIF 
                         And if she's not?

                    It is all the same to the Many-Faced God. 
                                        
          Jaqen leaves.

          Qyburn peeks through the window in Cersei's cell door. Then he open the door itself. Cersei is still 
          sitting on the floor.

          Qyburn enters the cell. The door closes behind him.

                       The trial will take place soon.

          Qyburn pauses, then speaks carefully.

                    but belief is so often the death of reason. 
                                        
    01:13:48:17                         
                                        
          Cersei's voice is quiet.      
                                        
                           CERSEI

          Cersei clasps her hands in front of her.

          Cersei's expression is pained.

                    Your arrest and Queen Margaery's arrest,

                      the king has not taken them well. 
                                        
    01:14:35:07                         
                                        
          Cersei listens with her mouth slightly open. 
                                        
                        QYBURN (OS - CONT'D) 
                       He remains in his chambers. 
                                        
    01:14:36:28                         
                         QYBURN (CONT'D) 
                 His servants often find his food in the hall left untouched.

          Cersei stands directly in front of Qyburn and whispers urgently. Her voice is full of emotion. 
                                        
                           CERSEI

                         QYBURN (CONT'D) 
                    He wouldn't see me. He won't see anyone. 
                                        
    01:14:52:18                         
                                        
          Cersei seems nearly in tears.  
                                        
                           CERSEI 
                         I can't stay here. 
                                        
    01:14:55:21                         
                                        
          Qyburn whispers.              
                                        
                           QYBURN 
                       There is a way, Your Grace. 
                                        
    01:15:02:23                         
                         QYBURN (CONT'D) 
                          A way out. 
                                        
    01:15:06:22                         
                                        
          Cersei whispers in response.  
                                        
                           CERSEI 
                           Confess? 
                                        
    01:15:09:19                         
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                        To the High Sparrow? 
                                        
    01:15:11:07                         
                                        
          Cersei's jaw is clenched.     
                                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                           I won't. 
    01:15:13:12                         
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                          I made him. 
                                        
    01:15:16:12                         
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                       I rose him up from nothing. 
                                        
    01:15:18:11                         
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                  I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner 
                                        
    01:15:21:04                         
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                        and beg his forgiveness. 
                                        
    01:15:30:14                         
                                        
          The cell door opens and Unella enters. 
                                        
                           QYBURN 
                        Good-bye, my queen. 
    01:15:34:14                         
                         QYBURN (CONT'D) 
                        The work continues. 
                                        
          Qyburn leaves. Unella looks at Cersei, who glares back. 
                                        
    01:16:11:26                         
          INT. SANSA'S CHAMBER - DAY    
                                        
          The door opens and Theon enters. He brings in a tray, then looks up to find Sansa sitting and staring at 
          him. Theon looks down again and puts the tray on a table near Sansa. 
                                        
                           SANSA 
                           Why? 
                                        
    01:16:15:16                         
                                        
          Theon shrinks back.           
                                        
                           SANSA 
                          Why, Theon? 
    01:16:17:04                         
                           THEON 
                      I'm not Theon. There is no Theon. 
                                        
    01:16:20:06                         
                         THEON,  SANSA 
                           Reek.  
                           Reek. 
                                        
    01:16:21:21                         
                                        
          Sansa's voice is hard.        
                                        
                           SANSA 
                       Why did you tell him, Reek? 
                                        
    01:16:25:05                         
                           THEON 
                         I was helping you. 
                                        
    01:16:27:16                         
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                        You wanted to escape. 
                                        
    01:16:29:01                         
                                        
          Theon speaks while looking down.  
                                        
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                         There is no escape. 
                                        
    01:16:32:00                         
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                           Not ever. 
                                        
    01:16:34:15                         
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                      Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. 
                                        
    01:16:37:29                         
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                         The master knew. 
                                        
    01:16:40:22                         
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                        He knows everything. 
                                        
    01:16:43:15                         
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                      He hunted him and caught him 
                                        
    01:16:45:27                         
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                       and strapped him to a cross 
                                        
    01:16:48:07                         
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                      and cut away piece after piece 
                                        
    01:16:50:16                         
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                      until there was no Theon left. 
                                        
    01:16:56:21                         
                                        
          Sansa nods just slightly. Her tone is vicious. 
                                        
                           SANSA 
                           Good. 
                                        
    01:17:01:18                         
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                    If it weren't for you, I'd still have a family. 
                                        
    01:17:05:25                         
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                     If I could do what Ramsay did to you 
                                        
    01:17:08:14                         
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                      right here, right now, I would. 
                                        
    01:17:15:16                         
                           THEON 
                        I deserved everything. 
                                        
    01:17:19:21                         
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                        I deserve to be Reek. 
                                        
    01:17:23:00                         
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                        I did terrible things. 
                                        
    01:17:26:26                         
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                         Turned on Robb. 
                                        
    01:17:29:20                         
                         THEON (CONT'D) 
                        Captured Winterfell. 
                                        
    01:17:32:10                         
                         THEON,  SANSA 
                         Killed those boys.                                        
                       They weren't "those boys." 
                                        
          Sansa stands and speaks passionately. 
                                        
    01:17:34:25                         
                           SANSA 
                  They were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers. 
                                        
    01:17:37:06                         
                         SANSA (CONT'D) 
                    You've known them since they were born. 
                                        
          Sansa stands over Theon as he cringes. 
                                        
    01:17:38:26                         
                           THEON 
                      They weren't. They were only-- 
                                        
    01:17:40:11                         
                           SANSA 
                          Only what? 
                                        
                                        
                                        
    01:17:42:04                         
                                        
          Theon blurts his words.       
                                        
                         THEON,  SANSA 
                           I can't.   
                           Tell me. 
                                        
    01:17:44:01

          Sansa grabs Theon's cheek.

          Sansa and Theon freeze, staring at each other. Then Theon speaks again. 
                                        
                         THEON (CONT'D)

          Sansa's lips part. Theon waits for a long moment.

          Sansa's voice is quiet and shocked.

          INT. DANY'S PENTHOUSE - DAY   
                                        
          Dany and Tyrion sit in chairs across from one another. Tyrion lifts a jug and pours for both of them. 
          Dany speaks ironically. 
                                        
                          DAENERYS 
                       So, have you decided yet? 
                                        
    01:19:52:27                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                     Whether I'm worthy of your service? 
                                        
    01:19:57:13                         
                           TYRION 
                Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed? 
                                        
    01:20:00:27                         
                          DAENERYS 
                      It's probably my safest option. 
                                        
    01:20:05:29                         
                                        
          Tyrion lifts his cup.         
                                        
                           TYRION 
                      I can see why you would think so. 
    01:20:08:10                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     It's what your father would have done. 
                                        
          Tyrion drinks.                
                                        
    01:20:11:12                         
                          DAENERYS 
                    And what would your father have done? 
                                        
    01:20:15:06                         
                                        
          Tyrion lowers his cup.        
                                        
                           TYRION 
                          My father, 
                                        
    01:20:16:25                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                    who publically sentenced me to death? 
                                        
    01:20:19:21                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear. 
                                        
    01:20:22:15                         
                                        
          Dany responds without pause.  
                                        
                          DAENERYS 
                       Is that why you killed him? 
                                        
    01:20:27:12                         
                           TYRION 
                    Someday, if you decide not to execute me, 
                                        
    01:20:30:19                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                    I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. 
                                        
    01:20:32:29                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     And on that day, should it ever come, 
    01:20:36:07                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                      we'll need more wine than this. 
                                        
          Tyrion drinks again.          
                                        
    01:20:40:26                         
                          DAENERYS 
                       I know what my father was. 
                                        
    01:20:43:07                         
                                        
          Tyrion listens.               
                                        
                       DAENERYS (OS - CONT'D) 
                          What he did. 
                                        
    01:20:45:21                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                     I know the Mad King earned his name. 
                                        
          Dany drinks.                  
                                        
    01:20:50:26                         
                           TYRION 
                         So, here we sit. 
    01:20:53:27                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   Two terrible children of two terrible fathers. 
                                        
    01:20:56:27                         
                                        
          Dany speaks without humor.    
                                        
                          DAENERYS 
                          I'm terrible? 
                                        
    01:20:58:20                         
                           TYRION 
                         I've heard stories. 
                                        
                                        
                                        
    01:21:00:24                         
                          DAENERYS 
             Why did you travel to the far side of the world to meet someone terrible? 
                                        
    01:21:04:04                         
                        TYRION,  DAENERYS 
                    To see if you were the right kind of terrible.                                         
                         Which kind is that? 
                                        
    01:21:07:04                         
                           TYRION 
                The kind that prevents your people from being even more so. 
                                        
    01:21:12:06                         
                          DAENERYS 
                     Well, I did reopen the fighting pits. 
                                        
    01:21:14:08                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                Under my rule, murder will once again become entertainment. 
                                        
    01:21:17:00                         
                                        
          Tyrion speaks brightly.       
                                        
                           TYRION 
                         Yes, that was wise. 
                                        
    01:21:18:23                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
               And you agreed to marry someone you loathe for the greater good. 
                                        
    01:21:22:04                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                         Very impressive. 
                                        
    01:21:25:00                         
                                        
          Dany listens.                 
                                        
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                  My own sister married someone she loathed as well, 
                                        
    01:21:27:19                         
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                     though not by choice and certainly not 
                                        
    01:21:30:02                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                      for the greater good, gods forbid. 
                                        
    01:21:32:06                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                      She ended up having him killed. 
                                        
    01:21:35:25                         
                          DAENERYS 
                      Perhaps it won't come to that. 
                                        
    01:21:45:18                         
                                        
          Tyrion seems to be searching for words. Then he speaks quietly, lifting his cup to his lips. 
                                        
                           TYRION 
                 It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all. 
                                        
    01:21:48:25                         
                          DAENERYS 
                      Varys? King Robert's spymaster? 
                                        
                                        
    01:21:52:00                         
                           TYRION 
                 Yes, he's the one who convinced me to come find you. 
                                        
    01:21:55:16                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                      He was my travelling companion 
                                        
    01:21:57:08                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself. 
                                        
    01:21:59:18                         
                          DAENERYS 
                      Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. 
    01:22:02:11                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
               For 20 years the Spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me. 
                                        
    01:22:06:06                         
                           TYRION 
                     He did what he had to do to survive. 
                                        
    01:22:08:23                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                He did a lot of other things as well, things he didn't have to do. 
                                        
    01:22:12:03                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
               I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib. 
                                        
    01:22:16:02

                         But you trust him? 
                                        
          Dany waits for his answer.    
                                        
    01:22:17:27                         
                          TYRION - OS 
                          Yes, oddly. 
                                        
    01:22:19:11                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   He may be the only person in the world I trust. 
                                        
    01:22:22:19                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                         Except my brother. 
                                        
    01:22:24:14                         
                          DAENERYS 
                      The brother who killed my father? 
                                        
    01:22:27:20                         
                           TYRION 
                         That's the one. 
                                        
                                        
    01:22:28:25                         
                          DAENERYS 
                     Perhaps I will have you killed after all. 
                                        
    01:22:30:14                         
                           TYRION 
                       Your queenly prerogative. 
                                        
    01:22:34:27                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                        I had given up on life 
                                        
    01:22:37:09                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                 until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. 
                                        
    01:22:40:27                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                      If you chop off my head, well, 
                                        
    01:22:43:14                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                      my final days were interesting. 
                                        
    01:22:51:18

                        I'm not going to kill you. 
                                        
    01:22:55:15                         
                           TYRION 
                         No? Banish me? 
                                        
    01:22:58:11                         
                          DAENERYS 
                            No. 
                                        
    01:23:00:07                         
                           TYRION 
                     So if I'm not going to be murdered 
                                        
    01:23:01:28                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     and I'm not going to be banished-- 
    01:23:03:11                         
                                        
          Dany leans forward in her seat.  
                                        
                          DAENERYS 
                       You're going to advise me. 
                                        
    01:23:06:18                         
                                        
          Tyrion raises his cup to her, but Dany removes it from his hand. 
                                        
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                   While you can still speak in complete sentences. 
                                        
    01:23:12:23                         
                           TYRION 
                        Advise you on what? 
                                        
    01:23:14:06                         
                          DAENERYS 
                        How to get what I want.

                          TYRION - OS 
                         The Iron Throne.

                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   Perhaps you should try wanting something else. 
                                        
    01:23:21:16                         
                          DAENERYS 
                    If I want jokes, I'll get myself a proper fool. 
                                        
    01:23:23:26                         
                          TYRION - OS 
                        I'm not entirely joking. 
                                        
    01:23:26:02                         
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                  There's more to the world than Westeros after all. 
                                        
                                        
    01:23:28:23                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
            How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? 
                                        
    01:23:32:29                         
                                        
          Dany stands and begins to walk around the room. 
                                        
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                      Perhaps this is where you belong, 
                                        
    01:23:34:27                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                      where you can do the most good. 
                                        
    01:23:39:04                         
                          DAENERYS 
                   I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay 
                                        
    01:23:42:03                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                  would ever know what it meant to be bought or sold. 
                                        
    01:23:45:00                         
                                        
          Tyrion nods as she speaks.    
                                        
                       DAENERYS (OS - CONT'D) 
                    I will continue that fight here and beyond. 
                                        
    01:23:48:18                         
                        DAENERYS (CONT'D) 
                        But this is not my home. 
                                        
    01:23:50:12                         
                           TYRION 
                 When you get back to your home,  who supports you? 
                                        
    01:23:53:01                         
                          DAENERYS 
                        The common people. 
                                        
                                        
    01:23:54:22                         
                           TYRION 
                  Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. 
                                        
    01:23:57:06                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
               Here in Slaver's Bay, you had the support of the common people 
                                        
    01:23:59:26                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                      and only the common people. 
                                        
    01:24:02:11                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                   What was that like? Ruling without the rich? 
                                        
    01:24:06:09                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       House Targaryen is gone. 
                                        
    01:24:08:18                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
               Not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. 
                                        
    01:24:11:16                         
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                       The Starks are gone as well. 
                                        
          Dany listens. Her expression may be disdainful. 
                                        
    01:24:13:19                         
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                     Our two terrible fathers saw to that. 
                                        
    01:24:15:15                         
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                    The remaining members of House Lannister 
                                        
    01:24:17:08                         
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                      will never back you, not ever. 
                                        
                                        
    01:24:19:05                         
                                        
          Tyrion looks alert, fully engaged in what he is saying. 
                                        
                           TYRION 
                    Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either. 
                                        
    01:24:21:19                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                His entire claim to the throne rests on the illegitimacy of yours. 
                                        
    01:24:25:03                         
                                        
          Dany's face gives away nothing.  
                                        
                        TYRION (OS - CONT'D) 
                        That leaves the Tyrells. 
                                        
    01:24:27:05                         
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                       Not impossible, not enough.

          the Night Watch Rangers.

          The Rangers row the boats toward the shore, where wildlings wait.

          The boats draw up to the shore and the men step out. They are confronted with the silent stares of 
          many wildlings. 
                                        
                          TORMUND 
                       You trust me, Jon Snow? 
                                        
    01:31:23:26                         
                            JON 
                       Does that make me a fool? 
                                        
    01:31:26:01                         
                          TORMUND 
                       We're fools together now. 
                                        
          They walk forward.

          The wildlings step aside for them. Then Rattleshirt advances toward them, wearing a mask and 
          surrounded by men.

          Tormund speaks grimly.        
                                        
                          TORMUND 
                       We should gather the elders, 
                                        
    01:32:07:14                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                      find somewhere quiet to talk.

                      You don't give the orders here.

                          TORMUND 
                        I'm not giving an order.

          Rattleshirt looks him up and down.  
                                        
                          RATTLESHIRT

                        He's not my prisoner. 
                                        
    01:32:20:13                         
                                        
          Both Tormund and Rattleshirt turn to look at him. 
                                        
                          RATTLESHIRT 
                            No?

                          What is he?

          Rattleshirt focuses on Tormund. He speaks harshly. 
                                        
                          RATTLESHIRT

                       You fight for the crows now?

                          TORMUND 
                       I don't fight for the crows.

                    We're not here to fight. We're here to talk. 
                                        
    01:32:43:28                         
                                        
          Rattleshirt addresses Tormund.  
                                        
                          RATTLESHIRT 
                          Is that right?

                        RATTLESHIRT (CONT'D) 
                  You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund? 
                                        
    01:32:49:24                         
                        RATTLESHIRT (CONT'D) 
                      And when you're done talking, 
                                        
    01:32:52:02                         
                        RATTLESHIRT (CONT'D) 
                  do you get down on your knees and suck his cock? 
                                        
    01:32:54:18                         
                                        
          Rattleshirt thrusts his club at Tormund. Tormund seizes it and hits Rattleshirt with it, knocking him 
          down. He beats him repeatedly.

          Tormund throws down the club and looks around in a challenging way. 
                                        
                          TORMUND 
                      Gather the elders and let's talk. 
                                        
          Tormund walks through the crowd, Jon following him. Rattleshirt lies still.

          Jon and Tormund stand with the Elders. A fire burns in the center of the Long Hall.

          Everyone listens quietly. Light from the fire shines on Karsi's face as she listens. 
                                        
                         JON (OS - CONT'D)

                     between you and what's out there. 
                                        
    01:34:08:20                         
                           KARSI 
                      You built that wall to keep us out. 
                                        
                                        
    01:34:10:11                         
                           LOBODA 
                  Since when do the crows give two shits if we live? 
                                        
    01:34:13:15                         
                            JON 
                In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. 
                                        
    01:34:16:18                         
                                        
          Jon speaks in a strong voice.  
                                        
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                 The white walkers don't care if a man's free folk or crow. 
                                        
    01:34:19:29                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                   We're all the same to them, meat for their army. 
                                        
    01:34:23:01                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                      But together we can beat them. 
                                        
    01:34:25:08                         
                                        
          Karsi sounds incredulous.     
                                        
                           KARSI 
                        Beat the white walkers? 
                                        
                                        
    01:34:27:12                         
                         KARSI (CONT'D) 
                   Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe. 
                                        
    01:34:40:03                         
                                        
          Jon approaches Karsi and holds out a bag. 
                                        
                            JON 
                          It's not a trick. 
                                        
                                        
    01:34:44:27                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                      It's a gift for those who join us. 
                                        
    01:34:52:25                         
                                        
          Karsi takes the bag and opens it. She removes a sharp-looking object. 
                                        
                            JON 
                          Dragonglass. 
                                        
    01:34:55:23                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                 A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers 
                                        
    01:34:58:29                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                         to kill a walker. 
                                        
    01:35:01:02                         
                          LOBODA , JON 
                          You saw this?  
                            No. 
                                        
    01:35:03:16                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                         But I trust the man. 
                                        
    01:35:05:02                         
                                        
          The Elders pass around the dragonglass, hodling it and looking at it. 
                                        
                           KARSI 
                    There are old stories about dragonglass. 
                                        
    01:35:07:19                         
                           LOBODA 
                 There are old stories about ice spiders as big as hounds. 
                                        
    01:35:11:12                         
                           KARSI 
                 And with the things we've seen, you don't believe them? 
                                        
    01:35:13:15                         
                                        
          Jon speaks in a persuasive voice.  
                                        
                            JON 
                   Come with me and I'll share these weapons. 
                                        
    01:35:16:07                         
                           KARSI 
                        Come with you where? 
                                        
    01:35:17:28                         
                            JON 
                    There are good lands south of the Wall. 
                                        
    01:35:19:23                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                  The Night's Watch will let you through the tunnel 
                                        
    01:35:21:14                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                    and allow your people to farm those lands. 
                                        
    01:35:23:27                         
                                        
          The Elders stir; they look around at one another. 
                                        
          ( murmuring )                 
                                        
    01:35:26:27                         
                            JON 
                        I knew Mance Rayder. 
                                        
    01:35:29:04                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                   He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch. 
                                        
    01:35:31:08                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                   He wanted a new life for his people, for you. 
                                        
                                        
                                        
    01:35:33:23                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                    We're prepared to give you that new life. 
                                        
    01:35:36:10                         
                                        
          Karsi is quick to question his offer.  
                                        
                           KARSI 
                            If? 
                                        
    01:35:38:03                         
                            JON 
                  If you swear you'll join us when the real war begins. 
                                        
    01:35:43:22                         
                           LOBODA 
                         Where is Mance? 
                                        
    01:35:48:20                         
                                        
          Jon waits a long moment, then speaks quietly. 
                                        
                          JON,  LOBODA 
                           He died.                                                              
                           How? 
                                        
    01:35:56:19                         
                                        
          Jon pauses again.             
                                        
                            JON 
                      I put an arrow through his heart. 
                                        
    01:35:58:17                         
                                        
          The wildlings lunge forward. Tormund holds out a calming hand. 
                                        
          ( wildlings shouting )        
                          TORMUND 
                           Hey, hey. 
                                        
                                        
    01:36:01:02                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                        Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
                                        
    01:36:05:07                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                          Hey, hey, hey. 
                                        
    01:36:06:22                         
                           LOBODA 
                     I say we send the Lord Commander 
                                        
    01:36:08:14                         
                         LOBODA (CONT'D) 
                      back to Castle Black with no eyes. 
                                        
          Loboda draws his sword. Jon does not move. Tormund pushes a hand against Loboda's chest. 
                                        
    01:36:13:26                         
                          TORMUND 
                      Hey, none of you saw Mance die. 
                                        
    01:36:16:05                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                           I did. 
                                        
    01:36:17:28                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                   The southern king who broke our army, Stannis, 
                                        
    01:36:21:07                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                   wanted to burn him alive to send us a message. 
                                        
    01:36:24:02                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                     Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders. 
                                        
    01:36:28:06                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                        His arrow was mercy. 
                                        
                                        
    01:36:31:10                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                       What he did took courage. 
                                        
    01:36:32:25                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                      And that's what we need today, 
                                        
    01:36:34:13                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                       the courage to make peace 
                                        
    01:36:36:07                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                   with men we've been killing for generations. 
                                        
    01:36:39:13                         
                                        
          Karsi speaks angrily.         
                                        
                           KARSI 
                       I lost my father, my uncle, 
                                        
    01:36:41:22                         
                         KARSI (CONT'D) 
                    and two brothers fighting the damn crows. 
                                        
    01:36:43:29                         
                                        
          Jon raises his voice.         
                                        
                            JON 
                     I'm not asking you to forget your dead. 
                                        
    01:36:47:06                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                        I'll never forget mine. 
                                        
    01:36:51:01                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                 I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the Wall. 
                                        
                                        
    01:36:56:10                         
                                        
          Jon speaks more quietly.      
                                        
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                         But I'm asking you 
                                        
    01:36:58:20                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                      to think about your children now. 
                                        
    01:37:02:22                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                    They'll never have children of their own 
                                        
    01:37:04:12                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                       if we don't band together. 
                                        
    01:37:06:26                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                       The Long Night is coming 
                                        
    01:37:09:23                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                       and the dead come with it. 
                                        
    01:37:11:22                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                        No clan can stop them. 
                                        
    01:37:14:12                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                      The free folk can't stop them. 
                                        
    01:37:16:08                         
                                        
          Jon speaks faster and faster, louder and louder. 
                                        
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                     The Night's Watch can't stop them. 
                                        
                                        
    01:37:17:22                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                    And all the southern kings can't stop them. 
                                        
    01:37:22:05                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                        Only together, all of us. 
                                        
    01:37:25:01                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                     And even then it may not be enough, 
    01:37:26:17                         
                          JON (CONT'D) 
                    but at least we'll give the fuckers a fight. 
                                        
    01:37:44:14                         
                                        
          They all consider his words. Finally Karsi speaks. 
                                        
                           KARSI 
                     You vouch for this man, Tormund? 
                                        
    01:37:49:22                         
                          TORMUND 
                     He's prettier than both my daughters, 
                                        
    01:37:52:24                         
                                        
          Karsi smiles slightly.        
                                        
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                       but he knows how to fight. 
                                        
    01:37:54:22                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                     He's young, but he knows how to lead. 
                                        
    01:37:58:24                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                     He didn't have to come to Hardhome. 
                                        
                                        
                                        
    01:38:00:24                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                      He came because he needs us 
                                        
    01:38:04:24                         
                        TORMUND (CONT'D) 
                         and we need him. 
                                        
    01:38:10:22                         
                           LOBODA 
                      My ancestors would spit on me 
                                        
    01:38:12:23                         
                         LOBODA (CONT'D) 
                       if I broke bread with a crow. 
                                        
    01:38:15:00                         
                           KARSI 
                    So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead. 
                                        
    01:38:24:19                         
                                        
          Karsi walks close to Jon. She studies him. 
                                        
          ( sighs )                     
                                        
    01:38:27:05                         
                           KARSI 
                      I'll never trust a man in black. 
                                        
    01:38:33:17                         
                         KARSI (CONT'D) 
                       But I trust you, Tormund. 
                                        
    01:38:36:04                         
                         KARSI (CONT'D) 
                       If you say this is the way, 
                                        
    01:38:39:14                         
                         KARSI (CONT'D) 
                         we're with you.

          ( murmuring )                 
                          TORMUND 
                         This is the way. 
                                        
    01:38:48:11                         
                           ELDER 
                         I'm with Tormund. 
                                        
    01:38:50:13                         
                         ELDER (CONT'D) 
                      We stay here, we're dead men. 
                                        
    01:38:54:09                         
                         ELDER (CONT'D) 
                    At least with King Crow, there's a chance. 
                                        
    01:38:57:12

          Everyone turns to look at Wun-Wun. 
                                        
    01:39:00:03                         
                          WUN-WUN 
                          Tormund. 
                                        
    01:39:06:06                         
                                        
          Loboda walks close to Jon. He speaks in ominous tones. 
                                        
                           LOBODA 
                     Keep that new life you want to give us.

                         LOBODA (CONT'D) 
                      And keep your glass, King Crow.

          The people are in a panic, shoving each other. Many jump into the water.

          INT. HARDHOME STOCKADE        
                                        
          A wight appears over the top of the stockade. Archers shoot it. 
                                        
          ( snarling )                  
                                        
    01:45:05:11                         
                                        
          Other men draw their swords. Wun-Wun looks around. 
                                        
          ( thumping, snarling )        
                                        
          Edd looks around as the stockade doors shake. 
                                        
    01:45:15:19                         
                                        
          Everyone watches the doors apprehensively. Wun-Wun looks up through the roof and growls. 
                                        
          ( growling )                  
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
    01:45:20:12                         
                                        
          Suddenly wights appear at the opening in the roof. Edd shouts and raises his sword as they come 
          leaping inside. 
                                        
          ( shouts )                    
                                        
          A wight's fist punches through the stockade gate. The gates tremble and push inward. A wight wriggles 
          underneath. Hands reach through cracks.

          Men and Karsi raise their arrows. They begin shooting the wights. 
                                        
          INT. HARDHOME STOCKADE        
                                        
          A man puts his shoulder to the gate, then jumps back as a wight bursts partway through. Another 
          wight is still struggling to enter under the gate. The man stamps on its head.

          People are running frantically. Someone falls, and Karsi stops to help him up. 
                                        
                           MAN

          People are piling into the skiffs. Some simply plunge into the water. 
                                        
          ( shouting )

          Tormund is on the shore. Karsi is assisting the man she helped up from the ground. 
                          KARSI, JON 
                          Wait, wait!                                                                
                     Duncan, hold the line!  Hold the line! 
                                        
          Karsi assists the man into the skiff. Another man grabs at her, and she hits him. 
                                        
    01:46:03:10                         
                                        
          Amid the chaos, a ranger shouts to Jon. 
                                        
                           RANGER 
                         Lord Commander!

                            JON 
                   Get them to the ship and come back for me! 
                                        
    01:46:07:27                         
                          RANGER,  JON 
                        But you'll never make--                                                        
                           Now!

          Jon turns and fights his way against the flow of the crowd. 
                                        
          ( people shouting )           
                                        
    01:46:12:15                         
                                        
          As the skiff begins to draw away, people splash after it, screaming. 
                                        
                     WILDLING WOMAN, WILDLING MAN

          Jon shouts to Karsi.          
                            JON 
                     You should be on one of those boats.

                     So should you. My little girls got on.

                         KARSI (CONT'D) 
                They're gonna let them pass the Wall even if you're not there?

                            JON 
                     You have my word. I've given orders. 
                                        
    01:46:27:28                         
                           KARSI 
                 Don't think you're gonna be there to enforce those orders. 
                                        
    01:46:30:25

          Jon turns to Tormund, who grasps his shoulder and points at the stockade. 
                                        
                          TORMUND 
                     If they get through, everyone dies. 
                                        
    01:46:38:27                         
                                        
          Jon draws his sword and shouts.

          Jon forces his way through the crowd. The Night's Watch follows.

          Wildlings are fighting the wights. There is a chaos of stabbing, hitting, and fighting.

          Jon and his men run forward, holding their swords. They slash and stab the wights. Tormund battles 
          them with his axe.

          Jon shouts to Tormund as he pins a struggling wight against the stockade wall. Tormund and others 
          grab the sleigh and carry it forward.

          Jon, Tormund, Loboda, Karsi, and the other warriors fight fiercely. Jon looks up; then Tormund does. 
          Mounted white walkers stand above them on the cliff. Loboda looks up and sees them also.

          Jon runs, fighting his way through the wights. Suddenly the Long Hall's roof bursts open. Jon ducks. 
          Wun-Wun strides out. 
                                        
          ( giant growling )            
                                        
          Wun-Wun wades into the fray, tearing apart wights and stomping them with his feet. Jon runs past 
          into the wreckage of the Long Hall.

          The Long Hall is burning; the fire is out of control. Jon and Loboda look at the fire. Then they see White 
          Walker X. He strides through the flames. 
                                        
                           LOBODA 
                          Get the glass. 
    01:50:16:27                         
                                        
          Loboda confronts White Walker X as Jon looks for the glass. They battle. 
                                        
          ( shouts )

          White Walker X stabs Loboda through the torso with his spear. 
                                        
          ( grunts )                    
                                        
          Loboda falls to the ground. Jon is still frantically looking for the dragonglass. 
                                        
    01:50:36:23                         
                                        
          Just as Jon grabs the bag with the dragonglass, White Walker X pulls him backward. Jon falls. 
                                        
          ( grunts )

          Jon rolls. He stands up just as White Walker X attacks, swinging its spear. Jon avoids the sword and 
          scrambles to another part of the Long Hall, where he finds a sword. They fight. Jon's sword shatters 
          against White Walker X's spear. White Walker X hits Jon and sends him sailing to the floor of the Long 
          Hall. Jon tries to rise, but clutches his ribs.

          Jon struggles to his feet and runs as White Walker X leaps forward. 
                                        
          EXT. HARDHOME SETTLEMENT      
                                        
          Jon runs outside and finds another sword. He lifts it, runs, and falls. 
                                        
          ( gasps )

          White Walker X strides grimly from the Long Hall. Jon is still struggling to stand. White Walker X raises 
          its spear and brings it down. Jon rises to his knees with the sword and, just in time, blocks the spear. 
                                        
          ( rings )

          White Walker X and Jon look at each other, almost in surprise. Then they draw back their weapons and 
          attack with all their strength. 
                                        
          ( grunts )                    
                                        
          Jon hits White Walker X with his sword. It shatters into many pieces. Jon bends over, gasping.

          Jon is on his knees. He falls forward. Around him the battle goes on. Tormund hits a wight with his 
          sword. Karsi kills many others.

          Several Child Corpses stand in front of Karsi. They look at her with dead eyes. Suddenly they race 
          toward her. Karsi crosses her arms in front of her body as they leap on her.

          Edd helps Jon to stand. Jon can barely speak.

          An army of wights plunges down over the cliff. Then they stand and begin to approach.

          Edd and Jon begin running to the shore. Tormund is still near the stockade, fighting the wights.

          Tormund looks toward the sound of creaking wood. The walls of the stockade are falling. They slam to 
          the ground, and the panicked people run from the stockade. Tormund runs as well.

          Jon turns and looks back at the shore. 
                                        
          EXT. HARDHOME SHORELINE       
                                        
          Wights are still attacking people; there is nothing Jon can do to help. 
                                        
          EXT. HARDHOME OCEAN           
                                        
          Jon looks on, his expression painful. 
                                        
          EXT. HARDHOME SHORELINE       
          Wights attack; people are dying.   
                                        
          EXT. HARDHOME OCEAN           
                                        
          Tormund and Edd watch the shore as well.

          The fight goes on, a bloody struggle.

          Jon can only watch.           
                                        
          EXT. HARDHOME SHORELINE       
                                        
          A man stabs a wight.          
                                        
          ( footsteps )                 
                                        
          The Night King walks out onto the dock. He stares after the skiff.

          Jon stands. The shoreline is receding as the skiff travels.

          The Night King watches Jon. He slowly raises his hands.

          The Night King holds up his hands. Many people lie dead, including Karsi. The Night King continues 
          holding up his hands. Karsi's eyes open. They look dead. Another person's eyes open.

          The dead are beginning to rise. Karsi sits up.

          Jon understands. The skiff rows away. Night is beginning to fall.
