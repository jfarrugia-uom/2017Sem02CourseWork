            Everything in the camp appears still in the darkness. The tents are covered in snow. 
                                          
            ( wind howling )

            A man is walking, too far away to be recognized. One tent shows a light.

            Melisandre stands in her tent, lit by candles. She turns her head and looks toward the door; then 
            she hurries over.

            Melisandre, holding a lantern, walks out of her tent and looks around. Suddenly, not far off, a 
            large fire flares up. Melisandre's eyes widen. 
                                          
                         MAN#1, MAN#2 
                          Look out!                                                                       
                           Fire! Fire! 
                                          
                                          
    01:02:34:21 
                                          
            Men begin running out of the tents. They start leading the horses away from the fire. 
                                          
             ( men shouting )  ( horse whinnies )

            An aerial view shows that fires are beginning all around the perimeter of the camp.

            Everything is chaotic; men and horses are running in all directions. Melisandre stands still, 
            watching. A horse, set on fire, gallops by.

            In daylight, the camp looks bleak. Men are walking among the ruined tents, sorting through the 
            damaged items.

                          DAVOS - OS 
                      A band of 20 men, maybe less.

                        DAVOS (OS - CONT'D) 
                  They were in and out before anyone spotted them.

                        DAVOS (OS - CONT'D) 
                     Burnt our food stores to the ground,

                        DAVOS (OS - CONT'D) 
                      all our siege weapons destroyed. 
    01:03:09:07                           
                                          
            Davos Seaworth is now seen walking with Stannos Baratheon. They are followed by a number of 
            generals. 
                                          
                         DAVOS, STANNIS 
                        Dozens of tents were--                                   
                           Horses? 
                                          
                                          
    01:03:11:15 
                                          
                           DAVOS 
                  We're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead. 
                                          
                                          
    01:03:13:23 
                                          
            Stannis speaks roughly.       
                                          
                           STANNIS 
              20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm? 
                                          
                                          
    01:03:17:22 
                                          
                           DAVOS 
               The northerners know more about their land than we ever will. 
                                          
                                          
    01:03:20:03 
                                          
                           STANNIS 
                      Put last night's guards in chains. 
                                          
                                          
    01:03:21:18 
                                          
            Stannis speaks rapidly and angrily. Davos stops to listen. 
                                          
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                 Either they fell asleep or they conspired with the enemy. 
                                          
                                          
    01:03:23:20 
                                          
                         STANNIS, GUARD 
                    Find out the truth and then hang them.                                  
                          Your Grace. 
                                          
                                          
     
    01:03:27:05                           
                                          
            The guards walk away. Davos faces Stannis. 
                                          
                           DAVOS 
                Unless there's a thaw, we can't press forward to Winterfell 
                                          
                                          
    01:03:30:16 
                                          
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                and we don't have enough food to get us back to Castle Black. 
                                          
                                          
    01:03:33:02 
                                          
                           STANNIS 
                     We're not returning to Castle Black. 
                                          
                                          
    01:03:34:28 
                                          
                           DAVOS 
             Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters, 
                                          
                                          
    01:03:38:10 
                                          
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                but if we can't march forward and we won't march back... 
                                          
                                          
    01:03:55:07 
                                          
            Davos pauses. He looks over his shoulder to see Melisandre and Selyse Baratheon staring at them. 
            Quickly, he turns back to Stannis. Their eyes lock. Then Stannis looks beyond him to the women. 
                                          
                           STANNIS 
                    Have the dead horses butchered for meat. 
                                          
            Stannis walks away. He passes the women without acknowledging them. First Melisandre, then 
            Selyse, follow him. Davos stares after them, his expression grim.

            Jon Snow is walking through a blowing snowstorm. It becomes apparent that he is followed by a 
            large group of people, including Tormund, Dolorous Edd, and many wildlings. At the foot of the 
            wall they stop.

            Jon looks up at the wall. He appears to be cold and tired. He takes a deep breath. 
                                          
            EXT. TOP OF THE WALL - DAY    
                                          
            Alliser Thorne looks down at the group at the foot of the wall. His expression is impassive.

            Jon and the others stand and stare. Jon and Edd look at each other. Then they look ahead. Jon 
            walks forward.

            Alliser, standing far above the crowd, sees Jon's tiny figure step forward. 
                                          
            EXT. WALL - DAY               
                                          
            Jon is looking upward, breathing heavily. 
                                          
            EXT. TOP OF WALL - DAY        
                                          
            Alliser stares down. Abruptly, he turns and walks past the Night's Watch guard who is standing 
            behind him. 
                                          
     
                           ALLISER 
                         Open the gates.

            Jon is still looking upward. Then the gates begin to open. 
                                          
            ( rumbling )                  
                                          
            Jon closes his eyes in relief.

    01:05:46:09 
                                          
            Seen from above, the wildlings are passing through the gate in a line. 
                                          
                           JON - OS 
                         It was a failure.

            On the ground in the courtyard, Jon stands with Samwell and Edd, watching the wildlings walk by. 
                                          
                           SAM

                      I went to save them. I failed.

            Sam indicates others.         
                                          
                         SAM (CONT'D) 
                           Or him.

                     I don't think that fact's lost on them.

            Wun-Wun enters the courtyard. Those watching, including Olly, sit up and take notice. Wun-Wun 
            walks slowly and quietly. Jon, Sam, and Edd stare up as he passes. Then Jon sees that the place 
            where Olly had been sitting is empty. Olly is just leaving the courtyard; he looks at Jon unhappily, 
            then walks out. Jon's expression is sad. Sam appears about to speak to him, but realizes that 
            Alliser is approaching them. Sam leaves as Alliser walks up to Jon. 
                                          
                           ALLISER 
                     You have a good heart, Jon Snow.

                        It'll get us all killed. 
                                          
                                          
    01:07:15:08 
                                          
            Without further conversation, Alliser walks away and passes through the line of wildlings. 
                                          
                        ALLISER (OS - CONT'D) 
                         Out of my way. 
            Jon stares after him, his expression bleak.

            Stannis is speaking rapidly, not looking at Davos.

                           Yes.

                  The King's Hand should never abandon the king,

                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                       especially in time of war. 
                                          
                                          
    01:08:12:09 
                                          
            Stannis' voice is emotionless.  
                                          
                           STANNIS 
                 You're not abandoning me. You're obeying a command. 
                                          
                                          
    01:08:14:07 
                                          
                           DAVOS 
                   A boy with a scroll could deliver this message. 
                                          
                                          
    01:08:16:15 
                                          
                           STANNIS 
                   And if Jon Snow refuses the boy with the scroll, 
                                          
                                          
    01:08:19:05 
                                          
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                       what does the boy say? 
                                          
            Stannis sets the scroll on the table. Then he stands and faces Davos.

                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                I didn't name you Hand for your expertise in military matters.

                 Ride for Castle Black. Don't come back empty-handed. 
                                          
                                          
    01:08:32:23 
                                          
            Stannis turns away and walks to the other side of the table. Davos is silent for a moment. Then he 
            speaks quietly. 
     
                           DAVOS 
                     Your Grace, perhaps Queen Selyse

                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                    and Princess Shireen could accompany me.

    01:08:38:26 
                                          
            Davos speaks more forcefully.  
                                          
                           DAVOS 
                       At least let me take Shireen.

                      A siege is no place for a little girl.

            Stannis is unbending.         
                                          
                           STANNIS 
                       My family stays with me. 
                                          
            Davos hesitates. Then he nods and leaves. Stannis does not move.

            A line of men stand, bowls in hand, shivering in the snow. Each is being served from a cauldron. 
            Davos walks past.

            Shireen sits at a table, turning over the pages of a book. She turns as Davos enters. 
                                          
                           DAVOS 
                        What's this one now?

            Davos' voice is kind and interested. He sits next to Shireen. 
                                          
                           DAVOS 
                     Now that sounds like a proper story.

                  Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar.

                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                He polished his shield for a week so that it was like a mirror. 
                                          
                                          
    01:09:36:08 
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                   And he crouched behind it and crept forward, 
                                          
     
    01:09:38:10                           
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                  hoping the dragon would only see its own reflection.

                           DAVOS 
                But the dragon saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield.

                           SHIREEN 
                       And burnt him to a crisp. 
                                          
                                          
    01:09:45:06 
                                          
            Shireen grins and Davos laughs.  
                                          
            ( laughs )

                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                      of Ser Byron Swann. ( laughs )

                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                      I made you something, Princess. 
                                          
                                          
    01:10:02:25 
                                          
            Davos hands Shireen a small carved figure of a stag. She cups it gently in her hands. 
                                          
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                         Do you like it?

                           SHIREEN 
                         He's beautiful. 
                                          
                                          
    01:10:06:06 
                                          
            Shireen kisses Davos' cheek.  
                                          
                         SHIREEN,  DAVOS 
                          Thank you.

                Will you make me a doe, too? So that he can have company?

                         Of course I will.

                      But why am I getting a present?

                       Because you deserve it.

            Davos seems to change the subject.

            Shireen listens carefully.    
                                          
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                    Seemed to me I could make it to the grave.

                   This is my own poor way of saying thank you.

            Shireen smiles. Davos takes a deep breath and stands. 
                                          
                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
                     I'll be gone for a few days, Princess.

            Davos kisses her forehead, then leaves. Shireen gazes at the stag carving.

                    That necklace was stolen from my room. 
                                          
            Doran and Ellaria look at each other silently. A servant places food on the table before Jaime. 
                                          
     
    01:12:13:14                           
                                          
                           JAIME 
                         Oh, excellent. 
                                          
                                          
    01:12:17:07 
                                          
                         JAIME (CONT'D) 
                     A last meal before the beheading? 
                                          
                                          
    01:12:19:11 
                                          
                           DORAN 
                        Oh, I can't behead you. 
                                          
                                          
    01:12:21:03 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                       Many in Dorne want war. 
                                          
                                          
    01:12:23:14 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                         But I've seen war. 
                                          
                                          
    01:12:25:16 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                   I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. 
                                          
                                          
    01:12:28:10 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                    I've seen the orphans starving in the cities. 
                                          
                                          
    01:12:31:25 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                   I don't want to lead my people into that hell. 
                                          
                                          
    01:12:33:27 
                                          
            Ellaria's tone is nasty.      
     
                           ELLARIA 
                  No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters. 
                                          
                                          
    01:12:36:23 
                                          
            Doran stares at her, unintimidated.  
                                          
                           DORAN 
                    And that is precisely what we are doing. 
                                          
                                          
    01:12:41:00 
                                          
            Doran and Ellaria glare at each other. Then he raises his voice and holds up his cup. 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                   Let us drink to Tommen, the First of His Name, 
                                          
                                          
    01:12:44:21 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                     King of the Andals and the First Men, 
                                          
                                          
    01:12:47:04 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                      Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. 
                                          
            Ellaria lifts her cup and pours the contents onto the floor, her expression scornful. Then she slams 
            the cup onto the table and reclines against her pillows. She stares at Jaime, who has drunk. 
            Myrcella and Trystane lower their cups, looking confused. 
                                          
                                          
    01:12:58:10 
                                          
            ( slams )                     
                                          
                                          
    01:13:06:27 
                                          
            Doran speaks to Jaime, ignoring Ellaria.  
                                          
                           DORAN 
                        King Tommen insists 
                                          
                                          
     
    01:13:09:12                           
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                     on his sister's return to the capital? 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:12:08 
                                          
            Myrcella's expression is anxious and unhappy. Jaime speaks quietly. 
                                          
                           JAIME 
                        I'm afraid he does. 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:16:13 
                                          
                           DORAN 
                     I cannot disobey my king's command. 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:19:17 
                                          
            Ellaria whips her head around to look at Doran. 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                    She will return with you to King's Landing. 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:22:07 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                 And my son Prince Trystane will accompany you both. 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:25:16 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
               If the alliance between the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue, 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:29:09 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                      their engagement must stand. 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:30:25 
                                          
                           JAIME 
                           I accept. 
    01:13:32:26                           
                                          
            Myrcella smiles in relief, but Trystane looks startled. 
                                          
                           DORAN 
                    One more thing. My brother was named 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:35:20 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                     to the small council before his death. 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:38:13 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                    Your father understood the importance 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:40:09 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                      of keeping Dorne in the fold. 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:42:10 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
              With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council. 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:46:23 
                                          
                           JAIME 
                        You have my word. 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:48:01 
                                          
            Ellaria almost snarls.        
                                          
                           ELLARIA 
                       The word of a kingslayer. 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:52:09 
                                          
            Ellaria stands. She spits her words at Doran. 
                                          
     
                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
                   No wonder you can't stand. You have no spine. 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:56:28 
                                          
            Ellaria begins to walk away, but Doran grabs her arm. His tone is quiet but ominous. 
                                          
                           DORAN 
                     You are mother to four of my nieces, 
                                          
                                          
    01:13:59:07 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                        girls I love very much.

                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                  For their sake, I hope you live a long and happy life. 
                                          
                                          
    01:14:03:29 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                   Speak to me that way again, and you won't. 
                                          
            Ellaria yanks her arm free and storms out of the room. 
                                          
                                          
    01:14:14:07 
                                          
            Jaime lifts his cup and speaks politely.  
                                          
                           JAIME 
                   May I inquire as to the fate of my man Bronn? 
                                          
                                          
    01:14:17:28 
                                          
                           DORAN 
                     Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing, 
                                          
                                          
    01:14:21:02 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                 how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince? 
    01:14:24:11                           
                                          
            Jaime's tone is indolent.     
                                          
                           JAIME 
                      He said it was just a fleabite. 
                                          
                                          
    01:14:28:19 
                                          
            Then his tone becomes more respectful. 
                                          
                         JAIME (CONT'D) 
                         The fault is mine. 
                                          
                                          
    01:14:30:08 
                                          
                         JAIME (CONT'D) 
                   Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. 
                                          
                                          
    01:14:32:13 
                                          
                         JAIME (CONT'D) 
                     If anyone should be punished, it's me. 
                                          
                                          
    01:14:35:28 
                                          
                           DORAN 
                Prince Trystane must learn judgment if he is to rule one day. 
                                          
            Trystane and Myrcella sit listening to Doran. 
                                          
                                          
    01:14:38:28 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                         I'll let him decide. 
                                          
                                          
    01:14:45:15 
                                          
            Jaime turns to Trystane. Trystane sits forward and speaks quietly. 
                                          
                          TRYSTANE 
                  I have learned the value of mercy from my father. 
                                          
     
    01:14:48:10                           
                                          
                         TRYSTANE, JAIME 
                        I'll set your man free.                                                   
                        You're a good man. 
                                          
                                          
    01:14:51:16 
                                          
                          TRYSTANE 
                         On one condition. 
                                          
                                          
    01:14:54:14 
            INT. CELL - DAY               
                                          
            Bronn sits in his cell. The Sand Sisters are in their own cell. Obara is sleeping, while Nym and 
            Tyene play the hand slap game. 
                                          
            ( hands slapping )            
                                          
                                          
    01:15:02:06 
                                          
            Nym smiles and speaks in a scornful way. 
                                          
                           NYM 
                     Why do we play? I'm better than you. 
                                          
                                          
    01:15:04:19 
                                          
                         NYM (CONT'D) 
                      I'll always be better than you. 
                                          
                                          
    01:15:06:29 
                                          
            Nym frowns in mock confusion.  
                                          
                         NYM (CONT'D) 
                       Have I ever missed once? 
                                          
                                          
    01:15:09:26 
                                          
                         NYM (CONT'D) 
                      I don't think I have. I can't recall. 
                                          
     
            Tyene's expression is determined, focused. 
                                          
                                          
    01:15:12:19 
                                          
                         NYM (CONT'D) 
                     You must love humiliation. Or pain. 
                                          
                                          
    01:15:15:07 
                                          
            Nym continues slapping Tyene's hands, speaking in a humiliating tone. 
                                          
                         NYM (CONT'D) 
                   Which do you love most, humiliation or pain? 
                                          
                                          
    01:15:20:07 
                                          
                         NYM (CONT'D) 
                       That one hurt, didn't it? 
                                          
                                          
    01:15:22:05 
                                          
                         NYM (CONT'D) 
                      ( smacks )    You going to cry? 
                                          
            Tyene does not respond to the taunts. Her jaw is set. 
                                          
                                          
    01:15:25:02 
                                          
                         NYM (CONT'D) 
                        Give up, little sister. 
                                          
                                          
    01:15:26:27 
                                          
            Finally Tyene speaks.         
                                          
                          TYENE, NYM 
                        You're going to miss.     
                         Oh, I never miss. 
                                          
                                          
    01:15:29:06 
                                          
                           TYENE 
                     You will. You're thinking too much. 
    01:15:32:11                           
                                          
            Nym hesitates. Her smile fades.  
                                          
                         TYENE (CONT'D) 
                    Now you're nervous. What if she's right? 
                                          
                                          
    01:15:38:26 
                                          
            Nym strikes, and Tyene whips her hands out of the way before the blow falls. Tyene smiles. 
                                          
                          NYM, TYENE 
                           Luck.    
                         Now it's my turn. 
                                          
                                          
    01:15:41:22 
                                          
                           NYM 
                         You're too slow. 
                                          
            Nevertheless, Nym places her hands together and holds them out. Her tone is still unpleasant. 
                                          
                                          
    01:15:43:14 
                                          
                         NYM (CONT'D) 
                      You've always been too slow. 
                                          
            Nym blows a kiss. Tyene slaps her across the face, sending her staggering back. Nym raises her 
            hand to her cheek and looks at Tyene in surprise. Tyene blows a kiss and smiles. Nym rushes at 
            her, and Tyene raises her fists. Then, hearing something, they stop and look around. 
                                          
                                          
    01:15:51:26 
                                          
            Hotah opens Bronn's cell door. He stands. 
                                          
            ( cell door unlocks )         
                                          
                                          
    01:16:01:27 
                              
            The girls watch from their cell. Bronn addresses Hotah. 
                                          
                           BRONN

            As Bronn passes, Tyene pushes her face between the bars of her cell. 
                                          
                           TYENE

            Tyene calls after him as he and Hotah walk away. 
                                          
                           TYENE

            Bronn stops smiling and looks at Jaime. Jaime raises his eyebrows and gesture to Hotah, who is 
            still standing next to Bronn. Hotah hits Bronn, knocking him to the floor.

            The sailors walk away. Arya does not respond. She is looking at the Thin Man, sitting at his table 
            and surrounded by guards. Then she begins pushing her barrow again.

            Arya stops near his table and takes out her vial of poison. She places it in a pouch at her hip. Then 
            she wheels her barrow closer, looking nervous. The Thin Man beckons her forward.

            Arya sees something. She wheels her barrow past his table, looking. The Thin Man looks confused. 
                                          
                        THIN MAN (CONT'D)

            A skiff is pulling up to the dock.

            Arya walks closer, staring. The Thin Man is sounding annoyed.

            Mace Tyrell steps from the skiff onto the dock. A sailor assists him.

            Tycho Nestoris walks up to Mace, smiling.

                         LHARA (CONT'D) 
                        We'll take half a dozen.

                         Three coppers. 
                                          
                                          
    01:21:41:17 
                                          
            Arya begins preparing the oysters. The young man hands over a coin. 
                                          
     
                           BRAVO 
                    Here's a silver because the lady likes you. 
                                          
            Arya looks over her shoulder to see a madame leading Trant into a back room.

            Arya watches quietly as a courtesan parades in front of Trant. 
                                          
                           TRANT

            The courtesan leaves and the madame calls another. 
                                          
                          MADAME

            Arya watches.                 
                                          
                         MADAME - OS

            Trant takes a drink and watches as the girl approaches.

                       MADAME (OS - CONT'D) 
                      But well worth it, I assure you. 
                                          
                                          
    01:22:52:22 
                                          
            The girl turns around in front of Trant.  
                                          
                           TRANT

            The madame nods at the girl, who leaves. 
                                          
                         TRANT (CONT'D) 
                      Do you have what I want or not?

            Arya watches as the madame leaves the room. Suddenly a hand falls on her shoulder.

    01:23:19:04 
                                          
            The guard eats an oyster and smiles.  
                                          
                         GUARD (CONT'D)

    01:23:25:24 
                                          
            The guard takes Arya into the back room. 
                                          
     
                         GUARD (CONT'D) 
                 Nothing better for your cockstand than fresh oysters. 
                                          
            Trant stares at Arya.

                          GUARD #2 
                          Any vinegar? 
                                          
                                          
    01:23:36:07 
                                          
            Suddenly the madame returns, speaking angrily. 
                                          
                          MADAME 
                      Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo! 
                                          
                                          
    01:23:38:14 
                                          
            Trant stares as Arya hurries out with her tray.

    01:23:58:26 
                                          
            The madame leads in a young girl, who stands before Trant. The guards wait and watch. 
                                          
                           TRANT 
                           Good. 
                                          
                                          
    01:24:10:16 
                                          
            Trant stands. The girl looks around nervously. The madame takes her arm and pushes her 
            forward. Arya watches from her place outside the room. Trant speaks to the madame. 
                                          
                         TRANT (CONT'D) 
                      I'll tell you when we're done. 
    01:24:17:23                           
                                          
            Trant pulls the girl away by her arm, then pauses and speaks to the madame. 
                                          
                         TRANT (CONT'D) 
                    You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow? 
                                          
                                          
    01:24:19:26 
                                          
            The madame tries to smile.    
                                          
                          MADAME 
                          Of course. 
                                          
                                          
    01:24:26:24 
                                          
            Trant leads the girl away. The madame notices Arya watching. 
                                          
                        MADAME (CONT'D) 
                       I'll have you whipped, girl.

            Arya hurries away.

                           And?

                           ARYA 
                     The thin man wasn't hungry today.

                     Perhaps that is why a man is thin.

                         JAQEN (CONT'D) 
                        A girl has work to do. 
                                          
            Arya nods and walks to where the man is now lying, having fallen. Jaqen watches her.

            INT. WATER GARDENS - DAY      
                                          
     
            Doran, sitting in his chair, speaks to Ellaria. 
                                          
                           DORAN 
                        Your rebellion is over. 
                                          
                                          
    01:25:33:17 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                   You can swear your allegiance to me now... 
                                          
                                          
    01:25:37:19 
                                          
                         DORAN (CONT'D) 
                         or you can die. 
                                          
            Ellaria looks furious. Doran stares at her implacably. Finally she kneels before him. The sisters 
            stand watching as Ellaria kisses Doran's hand. She weeps.

                       I believe in second chances. 
                                          
            Ellaria looks at him. Doran removes her hand from hers and speaks grimly.

                      I don't believe in third chances.

            Jaime sits at a table, writing. He turns his head as Ellaria enters. She surveys his work. 
                                          
                           ELLARIA 
                      You write like a seven-year-old.

                           JAIME 
                  Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.

                          ELLARIA - OS 
                      He didn't try to make you pay?

                          Mm-mmm.

                           ELLARIA 
                        Maybe he's changed.

                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
              The queen will be thrilled to know you're bringing her daughter home. 
                                          
                                          
    01:27:04:26 
                                          
            Jaime continues writing and speaks in an unconcerned way. 
                                          
                           JAIME 
                           She will. 
                                          
                                          
    01:27:06:07 
                                          
                           ELLARIA 
                     You love her very much, don't you?

                       Of course, she's my niece. 
                                          
                                          
     
    01:27:11:07                           
                                          
                           ELLARIA 
                       I wasn't talking about her.

            Jaime stops writing and looks up.  
                                          
                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
                        You think I disapprove?

                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
                           Why? 
                                          
                                          
    01:27:18:24 
                                          
                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
              Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? 
                                          
                                          
    01:27:21:24 
                                          
                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
                 They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. 
                                          
                                          
    01:27:25:00 
                                          
                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
                       Here no one blinked an eye.

                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
                         100 years ago,

                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
                    no one would have blinked an eye at you

                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
                      if you'd been named Targaryen.

                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
              It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not. 
                                          
                                          
    01:27:42:26 
                                          
                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
                     The only thing that stays the same

                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
                      is that we want who we want. 
                                          
                                          
    01:27:57:24 
                                          
            Jaime listens quietly. Ellaria walks closer to him. She speaks gently. 
                                          
                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
                 I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing

                      that happened to the man I love.

                         ELLARIA (CONT'D) 
                    Perhaps even you are innocent of that. 
                                          
            Ellaria leaves. Jaime looks thoughtful.

            INT. SHIREEN'S TENT - DAY     
                                          
            Shireen is playing with the little carved stag. 
     
            ( horse whinnying )           
                                          
                                          
    01:28:24:11 
                                          
            ( tent flap rustles )         
                                          
                                          
    01:28:25:26 
                                          
            Shireen looks around.         
                                          
                           SHIREEN 
                           Father. 
                                          
                                          
    01:28:31:07 
                                          
            Stannis is there, but he does not speak.  
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                         Aren't you cold? 
                                          
                                          
    01:28:35:03 
                                          
            Stannis sits near her.        
                                          
                           STANNIS 
                       No. What are you reading? 
                                          
                                          
    01:28:38:09 
                                          
                         SHIREEN, STANNIS 
                        The Dance of Dragons.                                          
                         What's it about? 
                                          
                                          
                                          
    01:28:40:26 
                                          
            Shireen speaks eagerly.       
                                          
                           SHIREEN 
                 It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen 
                                          
                                          
                                          
     
    01:28:43:11                           
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
               and her half-brother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms. 
                                          
                                          
    01:28:46:18 
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                 Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. 
                                          
                                          
    01:28:49:13 
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                When people started declaring for one of them or the other, 
                                          
                                          
    01:28:52:21 
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                    their fight divided the kingdoms in two. 
                                          
                                          
    01:28:54:24 
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                  Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons. 
                                          
                                          
    01:28:59:29 
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                   By the time it was over, thousands were dead. 
                                          
                                          
    01:29:04:03 
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                   And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. 
                                          
                                          
                                          
    01:29:06:28 
                                          
            Stannis listens with a serious expression. 
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                       They never truly recovered. 
                                          
     
    01:29:09:22                           
                                          
            Stannis' voice is very quiet.  
                                          
                           STANNIS 
                        The Dance of Dragons. 
                                          
                                          
    01:29:13:16 
                                          
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                        Why is that a dance? 
                                          
                                          
    01:29:15:23 
                                          
                           SHIREEN 
                       It's just what they call it. 
                                          
                                          
    01:29:17:08 
                                          
                           STANNIS 
                      Hmm, doesn't make much sense. 
                                          
                                          
    01:29:19:11 
                                          
                           SHIREEN 
                         I think it's poetic. 
                                          
                                          
    01:29:28:03 
                                          
            Stannis pauses. Then he speaks.  
                                          
                           STANNIS 
                        If you had to choose 
                                          
                                          
    01:29:30:26 
                                          
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                      between Rhaenyra and Aegon... 
                                          
                                          
    01:29:35:23 
                                          
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                      who would you have chosen? 
    01:29:37:07                           
                                          
            Shireen answers quickly.      
                                          
                           SHIREEN 
                      I wouldn't have chosen either. 
                                          
                                          
    01:29:39:29 
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                It's all the choosing sides that made everything so horrible. 
                                          
                                          
    01:29:42:28 
                                          
                           STANNIS 
                     Sometimes a person has to choose. 
                                          
                                          
    01:29:47:12 
                                          
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                     Sometimes the world forces his hand. 
                                          
                                          
    01:29:52:17 
                                          
            Stannis speaks slowly and deliberately. Shireen listens quietly. 
                                          
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                       If a man knows what he is... 
                                          
                                          
    01:29:56:26 
                                          
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                      and remains true to himself... 
                                          
                                          
    01:30:03:04 
                                          
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                      the choice is no choice at all. 
                                          
                                          
    01:30:05:13 
                                          
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                       He must fulfill his destiny... 
    01:30:10:21                           
                                          
                         STANNIS (CONT'D) 
                     and become who he is meant to be.

                      However much he may hate it. 
                                          
                                          
    01:30:20:00 
                                          
            Shireen speaks with sincerity.  
                                          
                           SHIREEN 
                        It's all right, Father.

                           STANNIS 
                   You don't even know what I'm talking about. 
                                          
                                          
    01:30:25:23 
                                          
                           SHIREEN 
                         It doesn't matter. 
                                          
                                          
    01:30:27:17 
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                        I want to help you. 
                                          
                                          
    01:30:29:23 
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                       Is there any way I can help? 
                                          
                                          
    01:30:39:07 
                                          
            Stannis hesitates for a long moment. Finally he speaks. 
                                          
                           STANNIS 
                          Yes, there is.

                   I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon.

                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                        And I'm your daughter. 
                                          
                                          
    01:31:00:29 
                                          
            Shireen embraces Stannis. He embraces her back and sighs. Then he whispers. 
                                          
            ( sighs )

                           STANNIS 
                          Forgive me.

            Guards lead Shireen through a snowstorm, while soldiers, lined up on either side, stare at her. The 
            crowd parts and make visible a wooden stake. Shireen slows, her face startled. Melisandre steps 
            out from behind some of the men. Shireen stops walking. 
                                          
                           SHIREEN 
                   Where's my father? I want to see my father. 
                                          
                                          
    01:31:49:24 
                                          
            Melisandre speaks in an unconcerned tone. 
                                          
                          MELISANDRE 
                      It will all be over soon, Princess. 
                                          
                                          
     
    01:31:56:25                           
                                          
            Shireen shakes her head and backs away, but the guards take her by the arms. They carry her 
            forward, kicking. 
                                          
                           SHIREEN 
                          ( crying ) No. 
                                          
                                          
    01:32:01:03 
                                          
            The guards set Shireen onto the platform. She shouts. 
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D) 
                        Where's my father?

            Soldiers gather around, watching.  
                                          
                        SHIREEN (OS - CONT'D) 
                   No, you can't do this.  Father, where are you? 
                                          
                                          
    01:32:05:20 
                                          
            Now Stannis walks forward. He watches. 
                                          
                        SHIREEN (OS - CONT'D) 
                      Please, let me see my father.

                        SHIREEN (OS - CONT'D) 
                   Father, where are you? Don't let her do this. 
                                          
                                          
    01:32:12:01 
                                          
                        SHIREEN (OS - CONT'D) 
                          Please let go! 
                                          
                                          
    01:32:14:27 
                                          
            Melisandre stands by as the guards tie Shireen to the stake. 
                                          
     
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D)

            Selyse now stands next to Stannis.  
                                          
                        SELYSE, SHIREEN - OS

            Selyse looks up at Stannis.

            Shireen is crying and panicked as the guards tie her up. Melisandre is calm.

            Selyse stands without moving.

            Finally Selyse reacts. She turns to Stannis and shakes his shoulder.

            Shireen is crying and struggling.

                    For the night is dark and full of terrors. 
            Selyse looks upset. Stannis' face is stone.

                         SHIREEN (CONT'D)

    01:33:10:27 
                                          
            Shireen fights and screams as Melisandre touches the torch to the wood underneath her. 
                                          
                         SHIREEN (CONT'D)

            Melisandre steps back.

            The soldiers stand watching.

            Selyse looks up at Stannis, who stares straight ahead.

            Selyse runs. She fights her way through the crowd of soldiers.

            Stannis stands. He closes his eyes. Melisandre watches over the flames, her expression satisfied.

            Stannis turns away from the fire, looking frozen.

            can be seen: Daenerys Targaryen, with Tyrion Lannister and Missandei sitting at her sides. Daario 
            Naharis stands behind her.

                   And in my experience, large men do triumph

                        HIZDAHR (CONT'D) 
                    over smaller men far more often than not.

                          DAARIO - OS 
                 Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, 
                                          
                                          
    01:37:39:18 
                                          
                         DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                   the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, 
                                          
                                          
    01:37:42:09 
                                          
            The fighters continue to attack each other with their swords. 
                                          
                        DAARIO (OS - CONT'D) 
                then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. 
                                          
                                          
    01:37:45:11 
                                          
            Daario suddenly whips out a dagger and holds it in front of Hizdahr's face. 
                         DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                   They couldn't get their money out fast enough. 
                                          
                                          
    01:37:47:24 
                                          
                         DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                 But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here 
                                          
            Daario points at his own head.

                         DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                          or... here. 
                                          
            Daario points the dagger tip at Hizdahr's throat. Hizdahr glances at Tyrion. 
                                          
                                          
    01:37:54:17 
                                          
            Daario puts away his dagger and sits.  
                                          
                         DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                    And the big men were always too slow 
                                          
                                          
    01:37:56:14 
                                          
                         DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't. 
                                          
                                          
    01:37:59:10 
                                          
                         DAARIO (CONT'D) 
               Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one standing across from me 
                                          
                                          
    01:38:03:07 
                                          
            Daario leans his face close to Dany's. She smiles slightly. 
                                          
                         DAARIO (CONT'D) 
                   making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy. 
                                          
                                          
    01:38:07:14 
                                          
            Fighter 2 slashes off Fighter 1's head.  
                                          
            ( shouting ) ( crowd cheering )  
                                          
                                          
    01:38:19:02 
                                          
            Daario leaves. Hizdahr gives a small smile. He looks at Tyrion, who appears uncomfortable. 
                                          
                          HIZDAHR 
                        You don't approve? 
    01:38:20:28                           
                                          
                           TYRION 
              There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. 
                                          
                                          
    01:38:23:29 
                                          
                         TYRION (CONT'D) 
                     I can do without it in my leisure time.

                          HIZDAHR 
                   Fair enough. Yet it's an unpleasant question, 
                                          
                                          
    01:38:28:19 
                                          
                        HIZDAHR (CONT'D) 
             but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?

                  It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be,

                      I'm not talking about myself.

                 I'm talking about the necessary conditions for greatness.

                         That is greatness? 
                                          
            In the arena, men are dragging away the fighter's body, while someone else picks up his head.

            Daario and Tyrion turn to look. Dany looks bereft. Jorah watches her somberly.

            The announcer backs away and the fighters begin to circle around one another. One comes at 
            Jorah with a spear. He ducks, then strikes out with his sword. In the combat, Jorah is knocked 
            down. Dany looks frightened.

            Jorah defends himself against attack. Tyrion watches tensely. Jorah is knocked down again, losing 
            his sword. He pulls out a knife and gets to his feet. Meanwhile, the champion kills another fighter. 
            Jorah stabs his opponent.

            Looking up at the royal box, Jorah throws away his knife and picks up a sword. The champion 
            confronts him. Their swords clash. Jorah receives a minor wound to the cheek.

            The women clasp hands. Dany closes her eyes.

            Everyone stops. They all look up.

            The arena is silent. Dany looks upward. Suddenly, a dragon appears flying overhead, trailing 
            flame.

            The dragon flies into the arena and lands. The Sons of the Harpy flee.

            The dragon bites apart one man. It blasts flame at another group.

            Tyrion looks on in astonishment. The men are burning and screaming.

            Dany stands still as people panic and run around her. The dragon burns many.

            The Sons of the Harpy begin throwing spears at the dragon, even as it bites them. Dany looks on 
            in distress.

            Dany walks to the dragon, which has a spear in its neck. She grasps the spear and pulls it out.

            The dragon roars in Dany's face. She stands still, her hair blowing back. It stops and Dany raises 
            her hand to its face. Suddenly comes the noise of a spear.

            Daario kills the Son of the Harpy who threw the spear. The dragon is floundering. Dany climbs on 
            its back while Tyrion watches.
