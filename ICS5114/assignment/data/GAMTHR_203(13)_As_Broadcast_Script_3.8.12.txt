               INT. CRASTER'S KEEP - NIGHT
               A dozen Night's Watch officers sleep on the filthy floor.
               The door flies open, rousing them from their sleep.
               Craster barges in, Longclaw in his hand, dragging a
               bruised and bloodied Jon Snow by the scruff of the neck.
                                   CRASTER
                        Out! All of you!
               He throws Jon at Commander Mormont's feet.
                                   CRASTER (CONT'D)
                        Bastard's been meddling where he
                        shouldn't. I want you and your men
                        gone. And, and you'll make this right.
               Mormont knows there's no arguing with Craster.
                                   MORMONT
                        Wait outside.
                                   JON
                        Lord Commander…
                                   MORMONT

               As various watchmen make their preparations to leave,

               ointment. Mormont emerges from the keep, furious, and

               heads straight for Jon.
                                    SAMWELL
                         Lord Commander…
                                    MORMONT
                         Leave us.
               Sam's face reddens and he scurries away.
                                    MORMONT
                         What did you do?
                                    JON
                         I followed him. He took the baby into
                         the woods, the newborn…
        01:02:52
                                    MORMONT
                         What business is that of yours?
                                    JON
                         No, you don't understand. He's killing
                         them, all the boys. He…
               Jon stops, noting the haunted, weary look on Mormont's
               face.
                                    JON (CONT'D)
                         You know.
               The Old Bear nods.
                                    MORMONT
                         The wildlings serve crueler Gods than
                         you or I. Those boys are Craster's
                         offerings.
                                    JON
                         Offerings? He's murdering his own
                         children! He's a monster...
                                    MORMONT
                         Aye, many a time that monster was the
                         difference between life and death for
                         our rangers, your uncle among them. We

                        Like it or not, we need men like
                        Craster.
               Jon can't bring himself to look at the Old Bear. He
               stares at the ground.
                                    JON
                        I saw it. I saw... something take that
                        child.
        01:03:54
               This news troubles Mormont.
                                    MORMONT
                        Whatever it was... I dare say you'll see
                        it again. Now ready my horse. We leave
                        at dawn.
               He's about to walk off when he remembers something. He
               hands over Longclaw, in its scabbard.
                                    MORMONT (CONT'D)
                        Don't lose it again.
               EXT. CRASTER'S KEEP - FAR SIDE - DAWN
               Gilly crosses the yard, noting the various watchmen
               decamping and loading their horses.
                                    SAMWELL
                        Gilly!
               Gilly turns to find Sam peering out from behind a
               woodpile. She creeps over to him, mindful of being seen
               by Craster.
                                    GILLY
                        You're leaving.
               Sam nods, deeply ashamed he can't free her from this
               life.
                                    SAMWELL
                        I... I wanted to give you something.

               He places a tiny brass thimble in her hand.
                                    SAMWELL (CONT'D)
                         It belonged to my mother.
                                    GILLY
                         I can't take it…
                                    SAMWELL
                         Please! I want you to. My mother used
                         it for sewing. She'd let me sit with
                         her in her chamber while she sewed
                         and... I'd read to her. My father put a
                         stop to it when he found out. It's the
                         only thing I have of hers. She gave it
                         to me before I left for the Wall.
                                    GILLY
                         You-you shouldn't give it away…
                                    SAMWELL
                         I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it
                         to you. Keep it safe for me ‘til I come
                         back.
               Gilly looks down at the tiny thimble in her hand, then
               back up at Sam. For a moment they stand together. She
               turns and rushes back to the keep. Sam looks after her
               for a moment, beaming. Then he turns to join his fellow
               watchmen heading north.

               DIREWOLF POV
               We pad through the archway from the Godswood into the
               courtyard, where Stark servants go about their duties.
               Hodor crosses into the POV and looks down at us,
               grinning.

                   Hodor, rouse Bran, will you? It's time
                   for his lessons.
           Hodor obeys and starts for the archway and we follow him
           across the yard and into...
           INT. WINTERFELL - CORRIDOR/STAIR - CONTINUOUS
           We follow Hodor through the corridor, up a flight of
           stairs and towards a door. Hodor opens it. We push past
           Hodor into…
           INT. WINTERFELL - BRAN'S CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
           Still in direwolf POV, we leap up onto the bed, looking
           down at Bran, who is sound asleep. Bran's eyes pop open
           and as he shoots up, with a gasp. Cut to a reverse angle
           of the last shot:
           Summer stands on the bed, staring straight at us, with
           Hodor standing just behind in the doorway.The giant's
           grin fades. Reverse angle on Bran, drenched in sweat,
           breathing heavily, terrified. This was no dream. He was
           inside his wolf.
           INT. WINTERFELL - BRAN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT
           Bran lies in bed.Maester Luwin sits beside him.
                            BRAN
                   Every night it's the same. I'm walking.
                   I'm running.But I'm not... I'm not me.
      01:06:53
                           BRAN
                   I'm running through the Godswood,
                   sniffing the dirt. Tasting blood in my
                   mouth when I've made a fresh kill.
                   Howling. Old Nan used to tell me
                   stories about magical people who could
                   live inside stags, birds, wolves...
                            LUWIN
                   And that's exactly what they are, Bran,
                   stories.

                        So she was lying? They don't exist?
                                    LUWIN
                        Well, they may have done... but they're
                        gone from the world, along with much
                        else. These are dreams, Bran. Nothing
                        more.
                                    BRAN
                        No. My dreams are different. Mine are
                        true. I dreamt of my father dying. And
                        Rickon had the same dream.
                                    LUWIN
                        What about all the dreams you've had
                        that didn't come true? Hmm?
        01:07:50
               Beat. Luwin lifts up his Maester's chain, fingering one
               particular link made of dark metal.
                                    LUWIN (CONT'D)
                        This link is made of Valyrian steel.
                        Only one maester in a hundred wears it
                        on his chain. It signifies that I have
                        studied the higher mysteries. And all
                        who study these mysteries try their
                        hands at spells. I was no different. I
                        was young and what boy doesn't secretly
                        wish for hidden powers to lift him out
                        of his dull life into a special one?
               Bran looks away from Luwin.He wishes this every day.
                                    LUWIN (CONT'D)
                        But in the end for all my efforts, I got
                        no more out of it than a thousand boys
                        before me. [LAUGH] Come on.
               Luwin tucks Bran in.
                                    LUWIN
                        Maybe magic was once a mighty force in
                        the world, but not anymore.

                         dead, the children of the forest
                         forgotten.

        01:09:57
               Loras manages to disarm his opponent, but the blue knight
               rushes him, toppling him to the ground. The blue knight
               draws a dirk, flips open Loras's visor, and holds the
               blade to his face.
                                    LORAS
                         Yield. I yield!
               The blue knight stands up, unsteadily. Loras stands and
               removes his helm, bewildered. Finally, a round of
               applause comes from the king himself.
                                    RENLY
                         Well fought! Approach.
               The blue knight approaches the dais and kneels.
                                    RENLY (CONT'D)
                         Rise. Remove your helm.
               The knight obliges and Catelyn's eyes widen in shock.
               The knight is a woman.
                                    RENLY (CONT'D)
                         You are all that your father promised
                         and more, milady. I've seen Ser Loras
                         bested once or twice... but never quite
                         in that fashion.

           He shoots his clandestine lover a look. Ser Loras is not
           amused.Margaery notices this.
                            MARGAERY
                   Now, now, my love. My brother fought
                   valiantly for you.
                            RENLY
                   That he did, my queen, but there can be
                   only one champion. Brienne of Tarth.
                   You may ask anything of me you desire.
                   If it's within my power, it is yours.
           Brienne gazes up at Renly, pure adoration in her eyes.
                            BRIENNE
                   Your Grace... I ask the honor of a place
                   in your Kingsguard. I would be one of
                   your seven, pledge my life to yours, and
                   keep you safe from all harm.
           The crowd murmurs their disapproval.
                            RENLY
                   Done! Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.
           Brienne rises, beaming. The king applauds, then the
           crowd applauds, Catelyn nods at her Baratheon escort, who
           steps forward.
                            BARATHEON GUARD
                   Your grace! I have the honor to bring
                   you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy
                   by her son, Robb, lord of Winterfell.

                   May I present my wife, Margaery of House
                   Tyrell?
                            MARGAERY
                   You are very welcome here, Lady Stark.
                   I am so sorry for your loss.
                            CATELYN
                   You are most kind.
                            RENLY
                   My lady, I swear to you I will see the
                   Lannisters answer for your husband's
                   murder.When I take King's Landing, I
                   will bring you Joffrey's head!
           A roar and shouts from the crowd.
                            CATELYN
                   It will be enough to know that justice
                   was done, my lord.
                            BRIENNE
                   Your grace. And you should kneel when
                   you approach the king.
                            RENLY
                   There's no need for that. Lady Stark is
                   an honored guest…
                            LORAS
                   Has your son marched against Tywin
                   Lannister yet?
                            CATELYN
                   I do not sit on my son's war counsels.
                   And if I did, I wouldn't share his
                   strategies with you.
                            LORAS
                   If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he
                   should come himself. Not hide behind
                   his mother's skirts.

                   My son is fighting a war. Not playing
                   at one.
           Angry murmurs from the crowd, but Renly laughs.Renly
           stands up to join Lady Catelyn.
                            RENLY
                   Don't worry, my lady. Our war is just
                   beginning.
           EXT. STORMLANDS - RENLY'S CAMP - DAY
           Renly leads Catelyn toward his tent. They pass a horse
           groom. Renly stops to chat with the man, who bows.
                            HORSE GROOM
                   Your grace.
           Renly claps the man on the shoulder.
                            RENLY
                   Gerard... how's your foot?
                            HORSE GROOM
                   Better, your grace. They don't know
                   their own size, is all.
                            RENLY
                   Good man.
           Renly smiles and continues with Catelyn.
                            RENLY
                   I have one hundred thousand men at my
                   command. All the might of the
                   Stormlands and the Reach.
                            CATELYN
                   And all of them young and bold, like
                   your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to
                   you, isn't it?
      01:13:54
           She shakes her head in sadness.

                   Why?
                            CATELYN
                   Because it won't last.Because they are
                   the knights of summer.And winter is
                   coming.
           Renly's smile fades. A flash of anger across his face.
                            RENLY
                   Brienne. Escort Lady Catelyn to her
                   tent. She's tired from her journey.
                            BRIENNE
                   At once, Your Grace. Shall I return
                   after…
                            RENLY
                   That won't be necessary. I would pray
                   awhile.Alone.
           He strides off. Brienne approaches Catelyn, who is still
           looking out at the camp, deeply troubled.
                            BRIENNE
                   If you’ll follow me, my lady...
           Catelyn follows Brienne and they walk away from the
           overlook, back down towards camp.
                            CATELYN
                   You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.
                            BRIENNE
                   I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight
                   for him on the battlefield.Die for him
                   if I must. And, if it please you,
                   Brienne's enough.I'm no lady.
           Cat smiles wistfully; this is just the kind of thing Arya
           would say.

               Theon doesn't realize Yara is already present. He looks
               around the room, lost in thought. Finally he sees Yara.
               He's startled and tries to hide his nervousness with
               anger.

                        You were a fat little boy, too. But I
                        recognized you.
               Theon, furious, gets up right in her face.

                        [LAUGH] And I did.
               Balon Greyjoy enters the chamber. Yara bows her head.

           Balon motions for them to follow him to a great table. A
           map of Westeros is laid out on it.
           He points at the map, to the Westerlands.

                   The wolf pup has gone south, with the
                   entirety of the northern army at his
                   back. While he's tangling with the lion
                   in the Westerlands, the North is ripe
                   for the taking.
           His bony finger traces a line from Pyke to the various
           points up and down the northwestern coast.
                            BALON (CONT'D)
                   The Ironborn will reave and pillage as
                   it was in the old days, all along the
                   northern coast. We will spread our
                   dominion across the green lands,
                   securing the Neck and everything above.
                   Every stronghold will yield, one by one.
                   Winterfell may defy us for a year, but
                   what of it? The rest shall be ours,
                   forest, field and hall.
           Theon looks uneasy.
                            BALON
                   Yara, my daughter. You’ll take thirty
                   longships to attack Deepwood Motte.

                   I've always wanted a castle.

                   would be our allies? Rise up against
                   them and they could destroy us. But if
                   we pledge fealty to them, they'll give
                   us Casterly Rock.

                        What are our words? Our words.

                        We do not sow.
                                    BALON
                        We do not sow. We are Ironborn. We're
                        not subjects. We're not slaves. We do
                        not plow the field or toil in the mine.
                        We take what is ours. Your time with

                        You act as if I volunteered to go! You
                        gave me away, if you remember, the day
                        you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon.
                        After he crushed you. Did you take what
                        was yours then?
               Balon backhands Theon across the face. Blood trickles
               down Theon's cheek but he does not hang his head. He
               glares right back at his father.
                                    THEON
                        You gave me away. Your boy. Your last
                        boy. You gave me away like I was some
                        dog you didn't want anymore. And now
                        you curse me because I've come home?
               Balon pauses in the doorway. The memory of his shame is
               still raw. He leaves the chamber.

           Tyrion attends to some paperwork at his desk. Shae paces
           around the room, looking at various objects, bored and
           restless.
                            SHAE
                   You won't let me leave this room, you

                   Why? You think your father can hear me?
                   He's three hundred miles away!
                            TYRION
                   I don't intend for you to stay here. I
                   might be able to bring you into the
                   castle kitchens.

                   Again, only temporary.
                            SHAE
                   You don't want me in the kitchens.
                   Every man who's tasted my cooking has
                   told me what a good whore I am.
                            TYRION
                   Oh, you wouldn't be a cook.You'd pose
                   as a scullion.
                            SHAE
                   A scullion? What is a scullion?

                   Yes, but…
                            SHAE
                   Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion

                   Your lion wants to see you alive. We've
                   come to a dangerous place. My sister
                   wants to hurt me.She'll look for any
                   weakness she can find... she can't know
                   about you.
                            SHAE
                   I am the weakness?
                            TYRION
                   It's a compliment, my lady.

                   How is being a weakness a compliment?
           Tyrion takes her hand.

           She leans in close to Tyrion, staring right into his
           eyes.

                   I am not a kitchen wench.

               and Tommen. But there's additional guest at supper:
               Sansa. She sits next to Myrcella and across from the
               queen. She keeps her head down and takes small bites,
               quietly suffering. They eat in silence, until…

                         Mother says I'll have a new gown for the
                         ceremony and another for the feast. But
                         yours will be ivory, since you're the
                         bride.
               Sansa stares at Myrcella, dismayed.

                         The princess just spoke to you.
                                    SANSA
                         Pardon, your grace. I'm sure your dress
                         will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm

                         done and I can pledge my love to the

                         Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's
                         brother?
               Sansa tries to hide her shock.
                                    CERSEI
                         He might. Would you like that?

                         No. I don't think so.

           Tears well up in Sansa's eyes as she looks away.
           INT. RED KEEP - SANSA'S CHAMBER - NIGHT
           Sansa sits in her chamber. She catches a glimpse of
           herself in the mirror.She barely recognizes herself. A
           soft knock at the door startles her.
                            SANSA
                   Come in.
           Shae enters, dressed in simple servant's garb.

                   teach you how to do your job.
           Silence.

                   Do you want me to leave?

           Sansa sits down. Shae starts to brush her hair.
           INT. RED KEEP - SMALL HALL - DAY
           Grand Maester Pycelle hands a small vial to Tyrion.
                            TYRION
                   Oh, thank the Gods. I haven't had a
                   proper shit in six days.
                            PYCELLE
                   Oh, I've encountered this problem
                   before, my lord. The stresses of power
                   often have this... insalubrious effect.
                   Two drops with water, daily.
                            TYRION
                   Ah, I'm grateful to have a man of your
                   vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
                   Please.
           Tyrion gestures toward the chair. Pycelle sits.
                            PYCELLE
                   Why thank you, my lord.

                         Why, yes, of course, my lord!
                                    TYRION
                         These are perilous times and the crown
                         must forge new alliances. And these
                         alliances must often be sealed in
                         matrimony.

                                    TYRION
                         I'm trusting the council with these
                         plans, but the Queen mustn't know. I
                         can't have her meddling in affairs that
                         could determine the future of the realm.
                         There's too much at stake.
                                    PYCELLE
                         Oh, yes. Yes, very, yes. I shall be
                         silent as the grave...
               Tyrion goes to the serving table and pours two cups of
               wine.
                                    TYRION
                         I'm brokering an alliance with House
                         Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella
                         will marry their youngest son when she
                         comes of age, insuring their loyalty...
                         and their army, should we need it.
               Pycelle strokes his long beard.
                                    PYCELLE
                         Myrcella... sent away to Dorne?
                                    TYRION
                         But remember, the Queen mustn't know.
               Tyrion hands the cup to pycelle.

                   I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off.
                   To Theon Greyjoy.
           That's a surprise, even to Varys.

                            VARYS
                   Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but
                   how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell.
                   He fights for Robb Stark.
                            TYRION
                   Precisely. Theon's father loathes the
                   Starks and will convince the boy to come
                   to our side.Greyjoy can destroy the
                   Northern army from within and we can
                   have his father's ships. But remember,
                   you must tell no one.

                   I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin

           Littlefinger considers this.
                            TYRION
                   Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the
                   promise of a royal match will convince
                   her to let bygones be bygones.
                            LITTLEFINGER

                   For men in our position, holding grudges
                   can be an encumbrance.Don't you think?
                            LITTLEFINGER
                   And I suppose you want me to broker this
                   agreement?
      01:27:00
                            TYRION

                            LITTLEFINGER
                   Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa. If
                   I cared to. What's in it for me?
                            TYRION
                   The gratitude of the people of Westeros
                   for helping to end this war. The
                   adoration of the King for bringing the
                   Vale back into the fold. And Harrenhal.
           Littlefinger's smug look vanishes for an instant. He
           looks away from Tyrion.
                            LITTLEFINGER
                   Harrenhal is cursed.
                            TYRION
                   I never took you for a superstitious
                   man. By all means, tear it down and
                   rebuild. You'll be able to afford it.
                   I plan to make you lord of the
                   Riverlands.
           Littlefinger turns to face Tyrion.
                            LITTLEFINGER
                   With a single stroke you'd make me one

                        So did Janos Slynt. And he was given
                        Harrenhal too, until you snatched it
                        away.

                        didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled,
                        then? Good. Oh, and remember...

               Loras and Renly kiss passionately, moving to Renly's bed.
               When Renly unlaces Loras's shirt, we see a massive bruise
               on Loras's body, a mark from Brienne.
                                    RENLY
                        Oh. That must hurt.
               Loras jerks away from him. Renly moves in for a kiss,
               but Loras leans away.
                                    RENLY
                        What? What is it?
                                    LORAS
                        A member of the Kingsguard? As if I
                        wasn't humiliated enough already.

               Renly moves to unlace Loras's breeches, but Loras stops
               him.
                                    LORAS
                        No, your grace. Not tonight. There's
                        another Tyrell who requires your
                        attention.
               Renly's face drains of color at the mention of his wife.
                                    LORAS
                        You didn't win my father's support or
                        his army on charm alone.
               Renly reaches for Loras again, and is rebuffed.

               Renly is alone, drinking. Margaery steps into the tent,
               wearing an elegant silk shift. She smiles at him. It is
               not a particularly demure smile.He smiles back,
               uncomfortably.

                                   RENLY
                        That's a lovely gown.
                                   MARGAERY
                        You think so? I can't decide how I like
                        it better. This way... or this way.
              She opens the front of the gown and drops the top to the
              floor.
       01:31:11

                        Although some say that the beauty most
                        desired is the beauty conceal...
              She cuts him off, pressing her lips to his, pressing her
              body to his. He does his best to respond in kind. Her

                   You monster.Myrcella is my only

               INT. PYKE - SMALL CHAMBER – NIGHT
        01:35:11
               Theon sits at a table in the dank, cramped chamber,
               staring at a scroll:
               Robb, I hope this reaches you in time...
               It's obviously a warning to Robb. Theon considers the
               paper in his hands. If he sends this, there's no going
               back. A single candle sits on the table, flickering.
               Theon stares at the flame, then again at the scroll in
               his hands. Finally, he holds the paper to the flame. It
               ignites and burns to ashes in hands.
               EXT. PYKE - ROCKY SHORE - DAWN
               As the waves crash against the rocky coast, Theon stands
               before a priest of the Drowned God, the deity of the Iron
               Islands. Theon's clothes are no longer in the fashion of
               Winterfell, but of the Iron Islands. Balon and Yara
               stand off to one side, observing the sacred ritual.
                                    PRIEST
                        Theon, of the House Greyjoy, you would
                        this day, consecrate your faith to the
                        Drowned God?
               Theon looks past the priest at his father.Balon Greyjoy

                   Kneel.
      01:36:08
           Theon kneels on the hard, stony ground.
                            PRIEST
                   Let Theon your servant be born again
                   from the sea, as you were. Bless him
                   with salt, bless him with stone, bless
                   him with steel.
           The priest lifts his waterskin, pulls the cork, and
           directs a thin stream of seawater down upon Theon's head.
           It drenches his hair and runs over his forehead into his
           eyes.
                            THEON
                   What is dead may never die.

                   What is dead may never die.But rises
                   again, harder and stronger.Stand.
           Theon rises, and locks eyes with Yara.

                   I don't appreciate being made a fool of,
                   dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell
                   boy, she can't very well marry Robin
                   Arryn, can she?
           Littlefinger's anger is difficult to hide.
                            TYRION
                   No, I'm afraid not. Sorry about that.

                   centerpiece of my next deception. My
                   brother Jaime rots in a northern
                   stockade. I would see him released.
                   That's where you come in.
                            LITTLEFINGER
                   Robb Stark will never release the
                   Kingslayer.

               INT. RED KEEP - PYCELLE'S CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER
               Pycelle lies in bed, Daisy curled up with him. The door
               is kicked open with a crash by Bronn, who bursts in,
               followed by Timmet and Tyrion. Pycelle recoils with a
               feeble cry. Daisy shrieks at the sight of Timmet and
               cowers in a corner.

                        swear it, it wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It

                        Littlefinger that I planned to wed her
                        to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I

                        All I did, I did for House Lannister.
                        Always.  Your lord father, ask him! I
                        have always been his servant... since
                        the days of the Mad King...

                        What? What? Oh no!
               Bronn lurches grabs Pycelle by the arm. With his other
               hand, he saws away at Pycelle's beard with his knife.
                                    PYCELLE

                            TYRION
                   But you let him die? Made sure he
                   succumbed?

                   Lannister... I always served
                   Lannister...
           Disgusted, Tyrion backs away.
                            TYRION
                   Get him out of my sight. Throw him in
                   one of the black cells.
           Bronn and Timmett grab the old man from the bed.
                            PYCELLE

                   don't! You can't do this to me!
           Tyrion sighs, exhausted, then notices Daisy still
           cowering in the corner. He takes a gold coin out from
           this pocket and places it on the arm of her chair.
                            TYRION
                   For your trouble.
           He glances at Pycelle, who is being dragged from the
           room.
      01:40:08
           Tyrion shakes his head and adds another coin on top.

               Yoren's Night Watch party has set up camp in and around
               an old stone tower.
               INT. RIVERLANDS - ABANDONED TOWER - NIGHT
               All the recruits including Gendry, Hot Pie, and Lommy are
               asleep. Except for Arya, who sits up against the wall,
               polishing Needle. Arya looks up to see Yoren watching
               her. He sits down beside her, pulls out his flask and
               takes a swig.
                                    YOREN
                        You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a
                        long march, thirty miles if it don't

               Yoren considers for a moment and offers her the flask.

           and glances at her without moving his head.

                   things.
                            YOREN
                   Aye. I've seen pretty things too, but
                   not nearly so many.
                            ARYA
                   How do you sleep when you... when you
                   have those... things in your head?
           Yoren knows exactly what she's talking about.
                            YOREN
                   You didn't see that. I made damn sure.

                        He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one
                        of those dimpled chins all the girls
                        like. I would think about him when I
                        was working, when I was drinking, when I
                        was having a shit. It got to the point
                        where I would say his name every night
                        before I went to bed. "Willem. Willem.
                        Willem." A prayer almost. And one day,
                        Willem came riding back into town. I
                        buried an axe so deep into Willem's
                        skull they had to bury him with it.
                        Willem's horse got me to the Wall, and I
                        been wearing black ever since.
               Arya stares at him.

               lying on the floor. He picks it up and runs out after

               EXT. RIVERLANDS - ABANDONED TOWER - NIGHT
               Lannister forces enter the camp, led by Ser Amory Lorch.
               Yoren and a few recruits face them. Arya and the others
               run for the bushes. Lommy, with the helm in hand, rushes
               past the prison wagon, knocking over a torch which sets
               the grass on fire.
                                    AMORY LORCH
                         Where's the bastard, crow?
                                    YOREN
                         Got more than a few bastards here.
                         Who's asking?

                                                                    EPISODE #203
                         Ser Amory Lorch. Sworn bannerman to
                         Lord Tywin Lannister. These men from
                         the capital requested our assistance.
                         Drop your weapons in the name of the
                         king.
                                    YOREN
                         Which king would that be?
                                    AMORY LORCH
                         This is your last chance. In the name
                         of King Joffrey, drop your weapons.
               Yoren considers a brief moment, then spits.
                                    YOREN
                         I don't think I will.
                                    AMORY LORCH
                         So be it.
               Lorch nods to a crossbowman, who aims his weapon and
               looses a quarrel into Yoren's chest.
               Arya, watching from the bushes, jerks forward to help
               Yoren but Gendry holds her back.
               Yoren stares down at the quarrel in his chest. He looks
               up at the crossbowmen.
                                    YOREN
                         I always hated crossbows...
               He advances on the soldier, who draws a fresh quarrel and
               starts loading the crossbow.
                                    YOREN
                         Take too long to load!
        01:48:00
               The soldier attempts to reload, but Yoren fells him with
               one blow. Recruits and soldiers begin to fight. Yoren
               is wounded, then backs up against Amory Lorch’s horse.
               Lorch drives his sword into Yoren’s neck, and he falls.
               Gendry rushes out to fight. Arya clutches Needle and
               moves to follow.

                                    JAQEN (O.C.)
                        Boy! Come here, boy!
               Arya whips around to see the wagon, now ablaze.Jaqen
               reaches out through the bars, calling to her.
                                    JAQEN
                        Sweet boy! Help us! Come here! Help
                        us, boy!
               The prisoners are a few seconds away from burning alive.
                                    JAQEN
                        Help us, boy!
               Arya hesitates for a half-second, considering the
               fighting around her.
                                    JAQEN
                        My men can fight! Free us!
               Her eyes find a large axe, its blade buried in log by a
               woodpile. Quick as a snake, she darts over to the
               woodpile, yanks the axe free and runs for the burning
               wagon.
                                    JAQEN
                        Quick, give it to me.
               She hands the axe into the wagon. Rorge picks it up and
               begins to hack at the cage bars.
               Gendry and the recruits fight bravely, but are
               overwhelmed.
        01:49:07
               Gendry is knocked to the ground by a soldier. Arya
               rushes to help, only to run into Polliver, who sends her
               to the ground with one punch. He takes Needle from
               Arya’s hand.
                                    POLLIVER
                        What do we have here?
                                    ARYA
                        No...

                                    POLLIVER
                        That's a fine little blade. Maybe I'll
                        pick my teeth with it.
               Hot Pie is dragged from the bushes.
                                    HOT PIE
                        I yield! I yield!
               Across the field, atop his horse, Amory Lorch calls out.
                                    AMORY LORCH
                        Round up any survivors. We'll take them
                        back to Harrenhal.
               Polliver yanks Arya up from the ground.
                                    POLLIVER
                        You heard him! You're coming with us.
               He shoves a bewildered Hot Pie forward.
                                    HOT PIE
                        I yield!
               Polliver and the goons round up the rest of the
               survivors, including Gendry. They march toward the
               center of the grassy yard, which is dotted with corpses.
               The gold cloaks inspect the corpses, looking for the one
               they want.
                                    LOMMY
                        Help. Help me...
               Arya turns and sees Lommy, lying on the ground, bleeding
               from the arrow in his leg. Polliver approaches him.
                                    POLLIVER
                        Somethin' wrong with your leg, boy?
                                    LOMMY
                        Look at it!
                                    POLLIVER
                        Can you walk?

                                    LOMMY
                         No. You got to carry me.
                                    POLLIVER
                         All right.
               He drives Needle into Lommy's throat. Polliver pulls the
               blade loose and Lommy's blood sprays out.
                                    POLLIVER (CONT'D)
                         Carry him, he says...
        The men laugh.
                                    AMORY LORCH
                         We're looking for a bastard named
                         Gendry! Give him up. Or I'll start
                         taking eyeballs...
               Arya notices a few of the recruits glancing at Gendry.

               She points at Lommy, dead on the ground.
                                    ARYA (CONT'D)
                         You already got him.
               The camera continues to pan past Lommy's body, to the
               bull's head helmet lying beside him.
                                    ARYA (CONT'D)
                         He loved that helmet.
