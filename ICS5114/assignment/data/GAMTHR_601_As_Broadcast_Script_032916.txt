          The man's face is now visible. It is Jon Snow, dead. The snow around him is stained with blood.

          Davos is leaning over a table. He lifts his head at the sound of howling.

          EXT. CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD - NIGHT 
                           
          Davos steps outside onto the upper walkway. He looks over the railing. From his viewpoint Jon's body is 
          just visible lying in the snow. 
                           
          ( Ghost whimpering, howling )

          Davos hurries down the walkway, looking over the railing as he walks. He runs down the stairs to the 
          lower walkway. He runs down the lower flight of stairs into the courtyard. He runs toward Jon's body.

          As Davos approaches Jon's body he slows to a walk, looking down. As other men run down the stairs 
          behind him, he stops and kneels.

          Jon's body lies motionless in the snow. Other men run up. They stop. Davos kneels without speaking.

          Davos stands as the other men gather around Jon's body and lift it. They carry it away. Davos stands still, 
          looking down at the bloody snow. Then he turns and walks away.

          Hands sweep items from the table to the floor. Jon's body is laid upon the table.

          Davos and the other men stand silently as Dolorous Edd approaches. Edd stands near Jon's body for a 
          long moment. He touches his wounds and looks at his bloody hand. He strokes Jon's forehead. Finally he 
          looks up.

          Edd sounds as if speaking is difficult. He looks around the room. 
                                        
                            EDD

          The men draw their swords. They stand ready. Melisandre's voice is heard through the closed door.

          Edd and the other men turn to look at Davos. Davos gives a slight nod. Edd walks to the door and open 
          it. The other men sheathe their swords. Melisandre walks slowly into the room. Edd closes the door.

          Melisandre slowly approaches Jon's still body. She scans his wounds and his gray face.

          Melisandre turns her head toward Davos, who answers with quiet emotion.

          Melisandre touches Jon's cheek. She withdraws her hand.

          The men stand, silently listening. Alliser speaks in a rough, forceful tone. 
                                        
                           ALLISER 
                     We've committed treason, all of us.

                         ALLISER (CONT'D) 
                     Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.

                         ALLISER (CONT'D) 
                        I had no love for him.

                     But I never once disobeyed an order.

                         ALLISER (CONT'D) 
                  Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night's Watch.

                   as no Lord Commander has ever done before.

                       and raped and murdered.

                         Jon was my friend. 
                                        
    01:08:36:02                         
                          EDD (CONT'D) 
                      And those fuckers butchered him.

                       Now we return the favor.

                       We don't have the numbers.

          Edd walks across the room, where the other men stand listening. 
                                        
                          EDD, DAVOS 
                        We have a direwolf.

          Davos speaks quickly.         
                                        
                           DAVOS 
                   I didn't know Lord Commander Snow for long,

                         DAVOS (CONT'D) 
             but I have to believe he wouldn't have wanted his friends to die for nothing.

                            EDD 
               If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room.

                 I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.

          Davos tries to change Edd's mind. 
                                        
                           DAVOS 
                    We need to fight, but we don't need to die.

                          DAVOS, MAN 
                        Not if we have help.

                 You're not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.

          Davos and Edd lock eyes for a moment. Then Edd turns to the man standing next to him. 
                                        
                            EDD 
                          Bolt the door.

          Edd leaves the room. The man closes it behind him. Davos sits watching.

          Standard bearers sit on their horses, waiting.

                     She was 11 the first time I saw her.

          INT. MYRANDA'S ROOM - DAY  
                           
          Ramsay sits near Myranda's body, which lies on a bed. Maester Wolkan stands by, listening as Ramsay 
          speaks. 
                                        
                         RAMSAY (CONT'D) 
                      The kennelmaster's daughter.

                        She smelled of dog. 
                                        
    01:09:49:16                         
                         RAMSAY (CONT'D) 
                I wasn't much older, but everybody was already afraid of me. 
                                        
    01:09:54:21                         
                         RAMSAY (CONT'D) 
                         You certainly were.

                       Myranda wasn't, though.

                  What could I do to her that those hounds couldn't?

          Ramsay speaks quietly. His tone is nostalgic. 
                                        
                         RAMSAY (CONT'D) 
                     There was nothing she wouldn't do.

          Ramsay stands. He puts a hand to Myranda's forehead. 
                                        
                         RAMSAY (CONT'D)

          Ramsay whispers to Myranda, his voice full of emotion. 
                                        
                         RAMSAY (CONT'D) 
                     I wish you could be here to watch.

          Maester Wolkan speaks in a low  
          voice.

                    Or would you rather the men build a pyre?

          Ramsay straightens. He walks across the room.

          Ramsay leaves the room. Maester Wolkan turns his head to watch after him.

          When Sansa lags behind, Theon puts his arm around her and helps her forward. He leads her to a huge

          Theon turns his head to look into the distance. He turns back to Sansa and whispers.

    01:21:25:05                         
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                    Have her lips peeled back from her teeth? 
                                        
    01:21:32:19                         
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                    I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.

          Jaime walks to Cersei. He kneels in front of her. 
                                        
                         CERSEI (CONT'D) 
                 I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.

          Cersei is on the verge of tears. Jaime whispers.

                   I have to. It's not right she has to suffer alone.

                          She was good.

                    From her first breath, she was so sweet.

                       She was nothing like me.

          Tyene, standing near the guards, nods. A Maester walks up.

          The Maester bows and hands Doran a scroll. He opens it. Ellaria waits as he reads in silence.

          Doran looks up quickly. Ellaria's daughter takes out a concealed knife and stabs Areo Hotah in the back. 
          He falls. Ellaria takes out her own knife and stabs Doran in the chest. The Maester turns and runs. Tyene  
          pulls her knife from the guard's body and throws it into the Maester's back as he runs. He falls. Doran 
          holds Ellaria's wrist and glares as she twists the knife in his chest. She pulls him from his chair and 
          throws him on the ground. He struggles as she stands over him.

          arm without speaking. 
                                        
    01:34:17:13                         
                                        
          Daario and Jorah gallop forward. They stop on a hill. 
                                        
                           DAARIO 
                          Huh, an army?

                          Not an army.

                           A horde. 
                                        
    01:34:49:06                         
                                        
          The men ride down the hill. They stop again. Jorah dismounts and walks away. Daario  takes his horse's 
          reins. Jorah walks cautiously. He stops and looks around. 
                                        
                           DAARIO 
                          Dothraki?

          Jorah looks around, then down. He bends and picks up a ring from the grass. He looks up at Daario. 
                                        
                           JORAH 
                         They have her. 
                                        
          Jorah clenches the ring in his fist.

          Dany, her hands bound, walks near two guards on horses. She stumbles. One rider hits her with a whip. 
          The riders smirk.

          carry scythes. Dany protests as they drag her to her feet.

          Arya swipes out with her staff, missing the Waif. The Waif backs up, then hits Arya in the stomach. She 
          hits her again and knocks her down. Arya rises and swings, missing. The Waif hits Arya across the face 
          with her staff.

          Arya turns in alarm, her mouth open. The Waif walks away, leaving Arya kneeling on the ground.

          Davos, sitting, looks up. Men standing near him draw their swords. Ghost, also nearby, growls. Davos 
          stands and walks to the door.

          Melisandre sits in front of the fire. She looks toward the table, where a candle is lit. She stands and 
          approaches the table, where a metal mirror stands. She removes her gown. Her reflection is visible in 
          the mirror. Next Melisandre removes her choker necklace. She sets it on the table. The mirror shows her 
          reflection. She has changed to appear old. Her reflection quivers in the mirror. Then it turns away. 
          Melisandre pulls back the bed covers and lies down.
