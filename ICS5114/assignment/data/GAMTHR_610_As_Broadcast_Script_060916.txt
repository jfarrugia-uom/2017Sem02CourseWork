                              LORAS (CONT’D) 
                      I am guilty of depravity...dishonesty,

                      I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven

                              TYRION 
                      I know it was hard  for you. You turned away a 
                      man who truly loves you  because he would 
                      have been a liability in  the Seven Kingdoms.  
                      That's the kind of  self-sacrifice that makes for 
                      a good ruler, if it's any consolation.  
        01:44:25 
                              DAENERYS 
                      It's not. 
        01:44:27 
                              TYRION 
                      No, I suppose not.  I'm terrible at consoling. 
        01:44:31 
                              DAENERYS 
                      Yes, you really are.  
        01:44:37 
                              TYRION 
                      All right, how about  the fact that this 
                      is actually happenin g? You have your armies,  you 
                      have your ships, you have your dragons.  
                      Everything you've ever wanted  since you were old 
                      enough to want anything,  it's all yours for the 
                      taking. Are you afraid?

                      Good. You're in the great game now.  And the great 
                      game's terrifying. The only people who  aren't 
                      afraid of failure  are madmen like your father.

                      Do you know what frightens me?  I said farewell to 
                      a man who loves me.  
                              DAENERYS (CONT’D)(OS) 
                      A man I thought I cared for. 
                              DAENERYS (CONT’D) 
                      And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with 
                      it.

                              TYRION (CONT’D) 
                      …I've been a cynic  for as long as I can remember.  
                      Everyone's always asking  me to believe in things -
                      - family, gods, kings, myself. It was often 
                      tempting until I saw where  belief got people.

                      And yet here I am.  I believe in you.  It's 
                      embarrassing, really. I'd swear you my sword,  but 
                      I don't actually own a sword.

                      day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere
