          A sword lies on a table, its hilt in foreground. A man can be seen out of   
          focus in background.

          Jon begins placing items in the bag. Edd slams the sword down on the   
          table. His voice is intense.

          The gates swing opent to show Brienne, Pod, and Sansa, all on   
          horseback. They ride forward. Across the courtyard, people stop what 
          they are doing and stare. Tormund is among them.

          The three riders arrive at the center of the courtyard and dismount.   
          Sansa looks around. She sees Jon and Edd standing on an upper walkway. 
          Jon descends the stairs and walks toward Sansa as others watch. He 
          stops a short distance from her. They stare at each other. Then they 
          embrace.

                    That is the way of the world. I am not here to

          Cersei, walking down the hallway, overhears a conversation. She pauses
