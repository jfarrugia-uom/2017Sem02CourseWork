           Bran and Three-Eyed Raven, walking among the carvings, come upon a   
           group of Leafs sitting together. The Leafs look up. One stands. Then the 
           others.

           A shirtless man is bound to one of the carvings. He is gagged. The Leaf   
           approaches him, holding a knife. The man struggles. Bran watches. 
                                               
           Outside the cave, Bran lies among the roots.

           Dany stands on a mountain overlooking the valley. She turns around;   
           Daario and Jorah stand behind her. She speaks to Jorah.

           Dany steps toward Jorah. He backs away. He rolls up his sleeve and shows   
           her his diseased arm.

           corpses. One turns its head to look at him.

           Sansa walks down a staircase. Brienne follows her.
